However, there are two distinct mtDNA clades, both evident in the Atlantic while only one is found in the Indo-Pacific (McDowell 2002). There is also no difference in pectoral fin length or in any other morphometric or meristic characters between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of sailfish (Morrow and Harbo 1969, McDowell 2002).","See the Supplementary Information for a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms used throughout this assessment.Sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) occur circumglobally and are caught as food and sportfish. The Indian Ocean stock, which represents 87% of this species' global population, based on known MSY, is overfished with overfishing occurring, and is estimated to have declined by approximately 27% to 33% over the past 12 years (2005–2017).Although there is some uncertainty, the eastern Atlantic stock has declined by approximately 60% over the past 3 generation lengths, or 12 years (2003–2015), and also may be subject to overfishing. In other parts of its range in the Western Atlantic, this species is increasing, but in the Eastern Pacific, this species may also be declining. The status of Sailfish in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean is unknown. Based on calculated declines for each stock over the past 12 years, weighted by the most recent known MSY, there has been an estimated 30% decline of Sailfish over the past three generation lengths. Given that the Indian Ocean stock represents the majority of this species' global population, where it is overfished and overfishing is occurring, this species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2.","In the Indian and Pacific oceans, Sailfish occur between approximately 45.5°N and 40.35°S in the western Pacific, 35°N and 35°S in the eastern Pacific, 45°S in the western Indian Ocean and 35°S in the eastern Indian Ocean. Based on differences in mitochondrial DNA, the population of Sailfish in the Arabian Gulf differs significantly from that in the western Indian Ocean (Hoolihan et al. 2004) and tagged individuals have all stayed within the Gulf (Hoolihan and Luo 2007). In the Eastern Pacific, Sailfish are found from southern California and the lower three fourths of the Gulf of California to Peru, including around all the oceanic islands. Sailfish are widely distributed in the tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean from approximately 40°N in the northwest Atlantic, 50°N in the northeast Atlantic, to 40°S in the southwest Atlantic, and 32° S in the southeast Atlantic, mostly associated with the shore, but there is a record from Ascension Island in the mid-Atlantic (Wirtz et al. 2014). Sailfish are reported (always as Istiophorus albicans) to have entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal, although the records are few and mostly based on juvenile specimens; there are also some records there from before the opening of the Suez Canal, possibly indicating Atlantic vagrants. Furthermore, in at least one case (Ben-Tuvia 1966), a specimen recorded from the Mediterranean as a sailfish was subsequently identified as a Mediterranean Spearfish, Tetrapturus belone (Collette and Graves 2019).","Sailfish are managed in five stocks: Western Atlantic, Eastern Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific and Indian oceans. In the Atlantic Ocean, the species is managed by ICCAT as Istiophorus albicans.Where possible, changes in population over a period of three generation lengths (approximately 12 years) were estimated for each stock using approximately 3 year averages for the endpoints and assuming a linear decline. Based on stock-size weighted changes in SSB, B/Bmsyor biomass,there has been an estimated 30% decline globally over the past 12 years (2000/2005–2012/2017). To account for differences in stock size, calculated declines for individual stocks were weighted by their most recent MSY. Atlantic Ocean There are two stocks of Sailfish in the Atlantic, the Western Atlantic and the Eastern Atlantic. The latest (ICCAT 2016) assessment results for both stocks were uncertain and caution should be used in interpreting them.In the Eastern Atlantic, the greatest declines in abundance were suffered prior to 1990 based on trends in abundance. The trend in recent years depends on the CPUE series selected. However, the stock is overfished (B/BMSY = 0.22-0.7) and overfishing is possibly occurring (F/FMSY = 0.33-2.85). MSY = 1635-2157 t (ICCAT, 2016). Based on the ASPIC model outputs for the eastern Atlantic (ICCAT 2016), B/Bmsy has declined by approximately 60% over the past 12 years (2003 -2015). With MSY estimated as 1,896 t, the eastern Atlantic stock represents about 7% of this species' global population.In the Western Atlantic, the production model formulations and the stock synthesis model had varying degrees of difficulty fitting the decreasing or increasing CPUE trends. Management recommendations were based on the stock synthesis models. In the Western Atlantic, the stock is likely not overfished (SSB/SSBMSY = 1.16-1.81) and overfishing is likely not occurring (F/FMSY = 0.33-63). MSY = 1438-1636 t (ICCAT, 2016). Based on model 1.1 and 2.1 (Fig. 20 ICCAT 2016) and management advice, SSB has increased by approximately 22% over the past 12 years (2002-2014). With MSY estimated as 1,537 t, the western Atlantic stock represents about 6% of this species' global population. Eastern Pacific Ocean IATTC (2019) conducted an assessment of sailfish in the Eastern Pacific using a surplus production model. However, the status of the stock could not be determined with respect to specific management parameters such as MSY, as it was not possible to derive from the model results the parameter estimates used in making these determinations. From 2013 to 2017, average annual reported catches were approximately 740 t, significantly below the 1993–2007 average of approximately 2,100 t. There was a downward trend in abundance during 1994–2009. Since then, abundance has been relatively constant or increasing slightly. According to the model results, the levels of unreported catch are significant, and the actual catch in earlier years probably exceeded those reported for 1993-2007. Assuming harvest was at this level for many years, the stock condition will probably not deteriorate if catch is not increased above current levels (IATTC, 2019). Based on biomass and B/Bmedian (IATTC 2019), this species is estimated to have declined approximately 16% over the past 12 years (2000–2012). MSY is not known, but most recent catch estimates from 2016 are approximately 500 t (IATTC 2019). Western Central Pacific The stock is managed by the WCPFC. There are no stock assessment data for the Western Central Pacific. Indian Ocean In the Indian Ocean catches of all billfishes have greatly increased from around 5,000 t in the early 1990s to almost 29,000 t in 2011 due largely to development of a gillnet/longline fishery in Sri Lanka and extension of the area of operation of Iranian gillnet vessels (IOTC 2013; Collette and Graves, 2019). Reported catches of billfishes rose to 33,280 mt in 2017 (IOTC, 2018a).The latest stock assessment for Indo-Pacific Sailfish was carried out in 2015, with additional indicators presented in 2019 using a C-MSY model. Based on data poor methods for the stock assessment using Stock Reduction Analysis techniques, the stock in 2015 was not yet overfished but was subject to overfishing. It appears that catches have continued to increase since then, indicating that levels of fishing mortality may be becoming too high. Aspects of this species’ biology, productivity and fisheries combined with the lack of a more formal assessment is also a concern. On the weight of the available evidence, it is determined that the stock in 2018 is still not overfished (B/Bmsy =1.14) but subject to overfishing (F/Fmsy=1.22) (IOTC, 2019). Based on the B/Bmsy C-MSY model and B/Bmsy Stock Reduction Analyses, there has been an estimated 27% to 33% decline over the past three generation lengths (2005-2017). With MSY estimated as 23,900 t, (IOTC 2019), the Indian Ocean stock may represent about 87% of this species' global population, however, as MSY is unknown for the Eastern Pacific and the Western Central Pacific, this proportion may be overestimated.",decreasing,"Sailfish are oceanic and epipelagic, spending most of their time in the upper 10 m (Hoolihan 2006, Chiang et al. 2013, Mourato et al. 2014) in a temperature range between 21 and 28 °C. However, on occasion they descend into deeper waters, greater than 100 m (Chiang et al. 2013, Mourato et al. 2014). Off the coast of Brazil, one of four Sailfish tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags made a dive exceeding 500 m (Mourato et al. 2014). It is the least oceanic of the billfishes, and it often migrates into near-shore waters. It is most densely distributed in waters close to coasts and islands. In the western Atlantic, it is concentrated particularly in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and around the West Indies and Florida. Distribution along the east coast of the United States appears to be influenced by meteorological conditions (wind) and by water temperatures; during summer, the fish move northward alongwith the extension of warm water, and with the beginning of cold weather and northerly winds they are driven back southwardto congregate in schools off the Florida coast. In the eastern Atlantic, shifts of the frontal zone of the Canaries Current and the Equatorial Counter-current are responsible for aggregation of the populations off West Africa; in spring the population in that area moves northward along the coast, and apparently returns toward the south in autumn, following the 28 °C isotherm; the period of increased abundance off the Ivory Coast coincides with the period of maximum surface water temperature, around 28 °C. The sporadic individuals found in the Mediterranean Sea seem to be vagrants, but their origin is uncertain because some were found before the opening of the Suez Canal (Nardo 1833, 1846). In both the eastern tropical Pacific and the eastern tropical Atlantic, Sailfish concentrate in shallower waters than in the western part of both oceans due to hypoxia-based habitat compression over oxygen minimum zones in the eastern tropical seas (Prince et al. 2010).Although Sailfish probably compete for food with many other large pelagic fishes, such as other billfishes, tunas, sharks and dolphin fishes, they are most likely less affected by food competition than other species of billfishes. In the Atlantic, Sailfish overlap in geographical range and hence, compete for food during certain seasons of the year, particularly with White and Blue Marlin. Around Florida, adults have been shown to feed mainly on pelagic fishes such as Little Tunny, halfbeaks, cutlass fishes, needlefishes, sardines, jacks as well as paper nautilus and squids (Voss 1953). Off the coast of Mazatlán, Mexico (Arizmendi-Rodríguez et al. 2006), the most important food items by both frequency and weight were cephalopods, particularly the jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) in 67% of the stomachs and paper nautilus in 58% followed by a triggerfish (40%) and frigate tunas (14%). Off northeastern Brazil, a fish (Brama brama) and a squid (Ornithoteuthis antillarum) comprised 47% of the diet of 101 Sailfish sampled (Vaske et al. 2004). Thirty-one species of fishes were found in stomachs of Sailfish from Brazil (Amorin et al. 2011) with sardines the most important (23.1%) followed by paper nautilus (12.7%). In eastern Taiwan, stomach contents indicated that Sailfish were generalist predators feeding mainly on epipelagic fishes especially Bullet Tuna, Auxis rochei (Tsai et al. 2014). Major food categories in the Indian Ocean (Ganga et al. 2012) are fishes (81% occurrence), crabs (31%), and squids (25%). In the eastern Arabian Sea, diet was dominated by finfishes (flyingfishes, frigate tunas, snake mackerels, and jacks) in terms of weight and frequency of occurrence but by squids in terms of numbers (Varghese et al. 2013). Sailfish also feed on bottom-dwelling organisms including sea robins (Triglidae), cephalopods and gastropods.Sailfish occasionally form schools or smaller groups of 3–30 individuals, but often occur in loose aggregations over a wide area. They most likely school by size. They undergo spawning migrations in the Pacific (Nakamura 1985).Sailfish appear to spawn throughout the year in tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific with peak spawning occurring in the respective local summer seasons. There are no external morphological characters or colour to distinguish males and females; large fish are usually females. Spawning occurs with males and females swimming in pairs or with two or three males chasing a single female. Around Florida, USA, Sailfish often move inshore into shallow waters where females, swimming sluggishly with their dorsal fins extended and accompanied each by one or more males may spawn near the surface in the warm season (Voss 1953, Jolley 1977). Spawning also occurs in offshore waters beyond the 100-fathom isobath south of Cuba and northwards to Carolina, USA from April to September (Gehringer 1956). In the eastern Atlantic, spawning has been observed in West African shelf waters throughout the year with peak intensity during the summer months in the Conakry-St. Luis region and from February to April in the Conakry-Freetown region (Ovchinnikov 1970). Spawning peaks in September and October and size at sex maturity is 150.2 cm eye-FL off the southeast Mexican Pacific coast (Cerdenares-Ladrón de Guevara et al. 2013). Oocyte development is asynchronous, resulting in fractional or multiple spawning and indeterminate fecundity (Jolley 1977, Cerdenares-Ladrón de Guevara et al. 2013). Off southeast Florida, a 33.4 kg female may shed up to 4.8 million eggs in three batches during one spawning season (Jolley 1977). Batch fecundity of Sailfish off the Pacific coast of Mexico, estimated for 21 females, was 1,710,000 ± 600,000 eggs per spawning (Hernandez-Herrera et al. 2000). The relationship between batch fecundity in thousands (F) and total weight of the fish in kilograms (w) was F = -245 + 61.68 w. Of 93 mature females, the average interval between spawnings was 3.6 days. Fecundity increases sharply with size of the female (Nakamura 1985, de Sylva and Breder 1997, Richards and Luthy 2005, Chiang et al. 2006a, 2006b, Wang et al. 2006).Cross-sections of the fourth dorsal fin spine were used to age Sailfish from southeast Florida, resulting in a maximum age of 7 years, although spines from the largest Sailfish were not available (Hedgepeth and Jolley 1983). The same method was applied to sailfish in waters off eastern Taiwan and the results indicated that growth differed significantly between the sexes; females grew faster and reached larger sizes than did males. The maximum age was 11 years for males and 12 years for females. The maximum size was 232 cm LJFL for females and 221 cm LJFL for males (Chiang et al. 2004). Sailfish grow rapidly, reaching 100 cm in the second age class, which is more than 50% of the mean asymptotic eye-fork length (Cerdenares-Ladrón de Guevara 2011; Collette and Graves, 2019). Usingthe best available data, longevity is estimated to be 13 years and age of maturity 2.5 years (Prince et al. 1986, Ortiz et al. 2003, IUCN SSC Tuna and Billfishes Specialist Group).Using a longevity of 13 years and age of maturity of 2.5 years, the generation length was estimated to be 4.3 years in the previous Red List Assessment. The generation length is calculated as: age of first reproduction + z * (longevity - age of first maturity), where z is 0.15 (Collette et al. 2011).Sailfish grow larger in the Pacific than in the Atlantic. The all-tackle game fish record in the Pacific is of a 221 lb. (100.24 kg) fish caught off Santa Cruz Island, Ecuador in 1947 while the largest sailfish from the Atlantic was only 142 lb., 6 oz. (64.6 kg) and was caught off Lobito, Angola in 2014 (IGFA 2016). The majority of sports fishing catches in southern Florida range from about 102 to 140 cm body length (or 173-229 cm total length) with considerable differences in weight (from 6.0-49.4 kg). The second-largest size group ranges from 61 to 94 cm body length, averaging less than 6 kg in weight. Small fish begin to appear in the catches in late summer, becoming prominent in November, December and January. The body length of individuals caught by commercial tuna longliners in the Atlantic ranges from about 125 to 210 cm (mostly between 150 and 195 cm). Sailfish taken by drift gill nets off eastern Taiwan ranged 80–289 cm lower jaw fork length for females, 78-227 cm for males (Chiang et al. 2009, Collette and Graves 2019).","In the Atlantic, Sailfish are primarily targeted by coastal artisanal and recreational fleets, but also caught as bycatch in longline, purse seine, trawl and gillnet fisheries (ICCAT 2016).In the Eastern Pacific Ocean, sailfish are mainly captured by: (1) the large-scale tuna longline fishery (mostly China, China Taipei, Japan and Korea); (2) the small-vessel longline fisheries targeting tuna and other species, and in particular, those operating off Central America; (3) the artisanal and recreational fisheries of Central and South America. Occasionally, the species is also caught in the purse-seine fisheries targeting tropical tunas, especially in more coastal regions (IATTC 2019).There are nearly year-round U.S. recreational fisheries for sailfish in the Florida Straits and southern Gulf of Mexico (NMFS 1998), and similar fisheries are increasing throughout the Caribbean Sea as more countries develop tourist-based recreational fishing infrastructure. Ditton and Stoll (1998) estimated that over 230,000 anglers in the United States alone target billfish for a combined 2,137,000 days annually. Billfish anglers are also among the highest spending saltwater anglers, with an estimated USD 180 million in expenditures by billfish tournament anglers in 1989 alone (Fisher and Ditton 1992, Collette and Graves 2019).In the Indian Ocean, around 70% of total catches come from gillnets, followed by 21% from troll and hand lines (21%). The remaining catches are recorded under longlines and other gears. This species is important for sport fisheries. Although there is not enough information to evaluate impact, the recent increase in coastal gillnet catch and effort is highly concerning. The 2017 catches (34,891 t) also exceed the catch limit prescribed in Resolution 18/05 (25,000 t) (IOTC 2018).","This is a highly migratory species is listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).There is a high amount of uncertainty in the Atlantic stock assessments. Conflicting abundance trends exist for both the Eastern and the Western stocks. Reported catches (including dead discards) may also be incomplete. In the Eastern Atlantic,it has been established that the total catch harvested must not exceed 1,271 t (67% of the average estimate of the MSY). However, the current catch is greater than this level (2,008 mt in 2019). In the Western Atlantic, it has been established that the catch must not exceed 1030 t (or 67% of the MSY average estimate). However, here also the current catch is greater than this level (1,258 mt in 2019). Domestic regulations have been established by some countries to limit the catch of sailfish. These regulations include the requirement to release all billfish from longline vessels, minimum size restrictions, and the use of circle hooks and catch and release strategies in sports fisheries (ICCAT 2016, 2021). In the Eastern Pacific, the IATTC recommends a precautionary approach that does not increase fishing effort directed at sailfish, and that monitors catch closely until there is sufficient data to conduct another assessment. To ensure a reliable assessment of sailfish resources in the EPO, it is also recommended that; (1) where possible, historical catch data be obtained; (2) catches be reported by species in fisheries where reports of sailfish catch are currently commingled with other species; (3) existing data from small-scale fisheries be compiled and that catch monitoring programs be implemented where necessary to enable identification of catches by species (IATTC 2019).In the Indian Ocean, Resolution 18/05 catch limits have been exceeded. It is recommended that mechanisms be provided to ensure none of the fisheries concerned exceed catch limits. There is also a need for further development of possible CPUE indicators from gillnet fisheries, and further exploration of stock assessment approaches for fisheries that are data poor. Furthermore, the lack of catch records in the Persian Gulf should be examined to determine the extent of localized depletion in Indian Ocean coastal areas (IOTC 2018).", This species is caught as bycatch and in targeted fisheries.

This species is a major component of recreational and commercial fisheries in throughout its range.Commercial catch figures and average sizes at capture of this species have shown remarkable stability over a very long period of time, and there is no evidence of any significant population declines, probably due to this species’ ubiquity in a very wide variety of inshore coastal habitats throughout its range. It is found in marine protected areas in parts of its range and minimum size and bag limits are in place for this species.

This species occurs to 35 m depth (Yearsley et al.1999).Records of this species from the northwestern coastline of Western Australia probably refer to A. palmaris. Both A. palmaris and A. australis are replaced around much of the southern coastline of Australia by A. butcheri, with which A. australis hybridizes in southern New South Wales (Rowland 1984). Its occurrence in Japan and the Ryukyu Islands (Masudaet al. 1984) and Taiwan (Shen 1993) are misidentifications most likely of A. chinshira.","Reported commercial catches and fishing effort for Acanthopagrus australisin estuaries declined during the 1990s (Industry and Investment NSW 2010).Most of the commercial catch is taken in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. The recreational catch has been estimated at c. 1,000 tonnes (Henry and Lyle 2003), which is much greater than the commercial catch. The exploitation status of the species is currently “fully fished” in New South Wales waters (Scandolet al. 2008). The stocks have remained apparently healthy despite the degradation of nursery habitats and estuaries in New South Wales (Kearney 2009). Catch landings and CPUE from 1985 to 2005 have remained steady as well as the average fish size from 1939 to 2006 (Scandol et al.2008).",stable,"Acanthopagrus australisis most commonly found in estuaries, and also occurs on rocky reefs, off headlands, and off surf beaches but can also occur within the lower freshwater reaches of coastal rivers. This species can occur in large schools over rocky reefs, and over sandy areas at reef margins (Kuiter 1996). Within estuaries, this species is associated with seagrass beds, mangroves, bare substrates and rocky reefs (Industry and Investment NSW 2010). Postlarvae and juveniles mainly inhabit seagrass beds in shallow estuarine areas (Dredge 1976), and recruits can remain within a single seagrass bed for at least three to four months (Worthington et al.1992).Food items include crustaceans, molluscs, worms and small fishes. Juveniles may consume algae. The maximum size recorded is 65 cm TL (Kuiter 1996), and c. 4.5 kg (Kailola et al.1993), though it is more commonly found to lengths of around 30 cm TL.Females are the oldest and largest, attaining at least 12 years and 39 cm (FL). Males can attain 10 years and 30 cm FL (Henry 1983). The maximum recorded age for this species is 22+ years (Gray et al.2000). Reproduction Acanthopagrus australisis a protandrous hermaphrodite (Pollock 1985).Spawning takes place in the surf zone off estuary mouths from as early as February in southern New South Wales, May-June in northern New South Wales, and July-August in Queensland (Grant 1991).This species undertakes a pre-spawningmigration from estuarine to coastal waters along the New South Wales coast from April to July (Gray et al.2000).Adults migrate from their feeding grounds to the spawning site. All mature males undertake the spawning migration but the proportion of mature females migrating to spawn increases with age (Pollock 1984). Acanthopagrus australis forms spawning aggregations generally in the surf zone off ocean beaches near the mouths of estuaries on the east coast (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2014).Most juveniles become functional males by the age of two years but a small proportion of them will develop directly into females (Pollock 1985).Other fish remain functional males throughout their life, while others develop directly to females at the age of four years (Dredge 1976, Pollock 1984). Females generally mature at around three years of age, at c. 17 cm TL, and males mature a year later at four years. Growth is slow, with most fish reaching c. 23 cm FL after five years (Scandol et al. 2008). Monthly changes in the gonosomatic index indicate that the yellowfin bream population in Moreton Bay has a seasonal spawning period with a peak from July to August (Pollock 1982).","There are no major threats to this species. Although threats to the species might be thought to include long term and continuous intensive fishing pressures, it seems to be remarkably resilient to such fishing activity, as average catches and fish sizes do not appear to have been greatly affected by this level of fishing over a very long period of time (at least since the 1950s). This resilience may in part be due to its ubiquity in a very wide range of estuarine and inshore coastal habitats. It can, however, be affected in some areas by habitat destruction and degradation, especially of seagrass and mangrove habitats, in southeastern Australia, and by water pollution. The stocks have, however, remained apparently healthy despite the degradation of nursery habitats and estuaries in New South Wales(Kearney 2009). Catch landings and CPUE from 1985 to 2005 have remained steady, as has the average fish size from 1939 to 2006 (Scandol et al. 2008). There may be some localized threats in southeastern Australia due to degradation and destruction of seagrass and mangrove habitats from anthropogenic activities and climate change (Walker and McComb 1992, Gilman et al.2008).Skeletal deformities, specifically saddleback syndrome (SBS),have been observed more frequently in recent years inA. australis individuals in southeast Queensland. SBS reduces the survival rate of individuals during early life history stages and may thus have harmful impacts. The mechanisms of this deformity are not yet defined but have been linked to environmental contamination (Diggles 2013).","The minimum landing size for A. australisis 25 cm TL with a bag limit of 20 fish in New South Wales waters (Accessed through NSW Government portal, www.trade.nsw.gov, accessed 3 March 2014).Restrictions on commercial fishing methods are also in place in New South Wales, and A. australisisalso protected by a number of estuarine and marine protected areas throughout much of its range (World Database of Protected Areas, accessed February 2014).","Acanthopagrus australis is one of the most valuable recreational and commercial sparids in eastern Australian fisheries (Hughes et al.2008) and is also one of the most common fishes caught by anglers. The recreational catch is estimated to be about double the commercial catch. The highest commercial catch is taken in autumn and winter. This speciesis a very popular food fish in Australia, where it is caught mostly by hook and line by anglers, but also by spearfishing, and commercially using seine nets, gill nets and traps, and to a lesser extent as a bycatch in trawl fisheries(Scandolet al. 2008, Industry and Investment NSW 2010)."

Reproduction Acanthopagrus latus is a protandrous hermaphrodite (Buxton and Garratt 1990); however, there is a divergence of opinion as to whether all of the individuals of A. latus are protandrous hermaphrodites or whether all or some individuals are essentially gonochorists (Kinoshita 1939, Abu-Hakima 1984, Abol-Munafi and Umeda 1994, Abou-Seedo et al. 2003).In the Guangdong Province China, this species spawns in late winter (Xia et al. 2008).In Taiwan, adults spawn in autumn (October) in coastal waters and the larvae move to estuaries (Hu 1983).

It is a large species that is found in highly accessible coastal habitat, and is the longest lived wrasse species. It is impacted by commercial and recreational fishing throughout its range. There have been declines of 60-90% over the past 20 years (since at least the 1990s) in at least a third of its range in the western part of its distribution, and assumed decline throughout its range due to fishing based on current low abundance in almost all of its range. Therefore, the overall population decline for this species is estimated to be at least 30% over the past 30 years, and will likely increase with continued commercial fishing. Although data on this species population and fishing effort is not available over the full three generation lengths (75 years), it is conservatively assumed that this species has been fished over the past 75 years, and the population trend before the 1980s was either stable or also in decline. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable. However, if older population or fishing data becomes available, this species may warrant reassessment as it may qualify for a higher threat category.","This species is a large long-lived wrasse that is endemic to the southwestern and southern coasts of Australia. Its geographic range extends from the Geraldton on the central western Australian coast to Bass Strait in the east. As this species only occurs in reef environments, its area of occupancy is estimated to be approximately 100,000 km<sup>2</sup>. However, its distribution within this range is not uniform.","Although the geographic range extends over 1,500 km along the Australian coastline, this species achieves relatively high abundances (seven individuals per 125 m<sup>2</sup>) at only one section of it geographical range around Esperance. In the northwestern part of its range, its abundance has declined since the 1990s between 60% (near Albany) and 93% (near Capes which is 635 km to the west of Esperance) based on recorded landings from commercial gillnet fisheries. Abundance in this western part of its range has correspondingly declined to about ~0.2 individuals per 125 m<sup>2</sup> (DeLacy 2008). This species has experienced declines of 60-90% over the past 20 years (since at least the 1990s) in at least a third of its range in the western part of its distribution, and due to fishing throughout its relatively restricted range, is considered to be in very low abundances and declining in almost all of its range. The overall population decline for this species is therefore conservatively estimated to be at least 30% over the past 30 years (J.H Choat pers. comm. 2008), and may likely increase with continued commercial fishing in some parts of its range. It is conservatively assumed that the population trend before this time was either stable or also in decline from fishing, and the population was in the same if not in greater abundance.",decreasing,"This is largest and longest-lived wrasse recorded, achieving a length of 170 cm and 70 years of age. The species is probably a protogynous hermaphrodite based on age and size distribution with a highly asymptotic growth pattern in both sexes and with males achieving a larger size than females. Spawning occurs in winter (June to October peaking in August). Recruitment to the reef habitat is highly episodic. Female maturity is late at 17 years, and occurs at a large size 653 mm TL with sex change at 35 years and at 830 mm TL. Based on a longevity of 70 years and first maturity of 17 years, average generation length is estimated to be 25 years. As this species does not typically change sex until a relatively old age (35-39 years), the abundance of the males of this protogynous hermaphrodite would be especially at risk of becoming depleted through fishing (Coulson et al. 2009).This species recruits onto more vegetated sheltered parts of reefs, and once they mature they move out onto deeper exposed coasts. Recruitment occurs on inshore reefs and larger individuals occur offshore on deeper reefs. Natural mortality is 0.054/year (0.021-0.090/year), and fishing mortality 0.039/year (0.003-0.073/year) (Coulson et al. 2009).","This species is subject to both recreational and commercial fishing including bylines, spearing and commercial gill netting. The commercial fishery is dominated by gill netting which targets individuals between 428-1,162 mm and six to 70 years of age (Coulson et al. 2009). In Western Australia in 2002 the recreational fishery for wrasse species caught 192,000 individual fish (Henry and Lyle 2003) which have a smaller mean size than those taken in the commercial fishery. The blue groper component can account for 90% of the catch (DeLacy 2008). Direct observation and CPUE data (DeLacy 2008) and estimates of yield per recruit and fishing mortality (Coulson et al. 2009) demonstrate that this species is overfished in Western Australian waters. In eastern Australia, this species has suffered such heavy fishing mortality in the 1980s, that the waters of that region were closed to commercial and recreational fishing for that species and still remain closed to spear and commercial fishing (Gillanders 1999).However, monitoring of this species populations by fishery independent methods is sporadic. The rapid increase in the use of improved technology (e.g. echo sounders, GPS) for coastal fishing since 1990 shows the major impact of these instruments on fishing effort.","The current bag limit in Western Australia is one per day and size limit of greater than 500 mm TL. This species is not protected in Victoria and is still subject to commercial fishing there. It is totally protected in the Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St. Vincent in southern Australia, although the records of this protection are linked to A. viridis but refer to A. gouldii. Management plans need to be developed and implemented, especially in western Australia where there is very little protection. Although this species exists in reasonable numbers in Esperance, there are continuing records of poor catches along the central Western Australian coast, and more fishers are moving down there. Moreover, research is needed on the population numbers and range, threats, conservation measures and trends (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008).",This species is fished commercially and recreationally over its entire geographic range.

These declines were stopped in the early 1970s when there was a ban on spearfishing and commercial fishing. Since then there has been no further decline in the population since that time. This species has a generation length of approximately 12-15 years.

It is also subject to substantial recreational fishing and minor commercial fishing throughout its range, although species-specific population information is not available (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2008).","Although it is the official New South Wales State fish emblem, this species is not a totally protected species in New South Wales. It is only protected against spearfishing, netting and commercial sale to protect it from large catches by spearfishers. In 1974, angling and commercial fishing were allowed again, but spearfishing was still prohibited. In 1975, concern over the large catches by commercial fishers led to a ban on bottom-set gill nets. All Blue Groper were banned from sale in 1980. There is currently a minimum size limit of 30 cm, and the bag limit is two per day with only one &gt; 60cm (Smith et al. 1996, Gillanders 1999).Angling is still allowed, with a bag limit of two fish in possession, taken by line only, and a 'slot' size limit of &gt;30 cm, with only one fish over 60 cm allowed. The spearfishing prohibition is in the form of a 'rolling' ban, renewed possibly every 10 years.

However, this species distribution includes a number of Marine Protected Areas within its range.Anampses caeruleopunctatus is present in the Bateman Bay, Ningaloo Reef Marine Park, Australia (Fitzpatrick and Penrose 2002), Elizabeth and Middleton Reefs Marine National Nature Reserve, Australia (Oxley et al. 2003), Booderee National Park, Australia (Australian Government 2006), Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa (Green et al. 2005) and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Kuiter 2006). Currently, creation of a fishing-free sanctuary zone in the Booderee National Park is under-reviewed (Australian Government 2006) and the proposal of establishing a 400,000 square mile Coral Sea Heritage Park, where fishing would be banned, in the Great Barrier Reef is under revising (Underwater Times 2008). Furthermore, in Micronesia, SCUBA fishing has been banned and Non-Governmental Organizations and Government are developing more MPAs (Kelty and Kuartei 2004). It is worth mentioning that marine parks or national parks do not necessary equal to no-fishing zones. For example, limited fishing is allowed for the licensed fishers in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Parks.A. caeruleopunctatus is also found in the Watamu Marine National Park, Kenya where fishing has been prohibited for more than 20 years (McClanahan et al. 2002) and the Cape d’ Augilar Marine Reserve, Hong Kong where recreational and commercial fishing are restricted (Cornish 2000).While many marine protected areas (MPAs) have been introduced within the geographic distribution range of A. caeruleopunctatus, such as Kiribati possesses the world’s largest marine protected area that comprising about 410,500 km<sup>2</sup> including the Phoenix islands archipelago and both Winslow and Carondelet reefs (PIPA 2008), In Philippines, there is a rapidly increase in the number of MPAs (Alino et al. 2000). Thus, it is believed that A. caeruleopunctatus might be present in one of those MPAs, but yet to be documented.However, marine protected areas, especially in the south and southeast Asia, countries, are considered to be poorly managed due to the lack of expertise, resource, effective co-ordination and proper enforcement (Chou et al. 2002, Tun et al. 2004). For instance, destructive fishing practises, unconfirmed dynamite fishing and anchor damage have been found in the Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary, Sri Lanka (Ohman et al. 1997). Thus, majority of these MPAs might not be able to provide sufficient protection to the species that they are housing.","This species is captured for the marine aquarium trade in Reunion Island (Mulochau and Durville 2005), Queensland, Australia (Whitehead et al. 1986), Mozambique (Whittington et al. 2000) and the Red Sea (PERSGA 2004). Exported and marketed price for this species has not been documented. Further, according to Shao (2008), A. caeruleopunctatus is categorized as both food fish and marine ornamental fish species.It was found in the Hong Kong local fish market (Situ and Sadovy 2004) and is occasionally trawled (Sommer et al. 1996), but Westneat (2001) noted that A. caeruleopunctatus is not commonly seen in the fish market, globally."

Where there is greatly reduced fishing pressure, density is substantially higher.The highest densities were reported in the US Line Islands &amp; Phoenix Islands region from between 19.4 and 63 individuals per hectare as compared to the main Hawaiian Islands (0.15 to 8.4 individuals). At Timor Leste, the recorded density of A. furca was 2.5/ha. (NOAA unpublished data as described in Heenan et al. 2014).In Fisheries Independent fish density surveys, the Federated States of Micronesia showed densities ranging from 3.2/ha ( off Satawal) to 17.2/ha (off Kosrae) (Brett Taylor, unpublished data). Near the Solomon Islands, surveys around the populous islands showed a mean density of 0.7/ha, and surveys around the remote islands showed a mean density of 2.1/ha (Alison Green, unpublished data). Off Fiji, the density of this species was recorded at 0.3/ha (Stacey Jupiter, unpublished data), and off Raja Ampat, its density was 0.05/ha (Alison Green, unpublished data).",unknown,"Aphareus furca is a pelagic and benthopelagicspecies that inhabits inshore coral and rocky reef areas, rocky bottoms and in clear water lagoons.

During 2002, 120 tonnes ofA. spiniferwere landed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (Grandcourtet al. 2004). FAO landings for this species show increases in total catches for the Persian Gulf from 1980 through 2007 (FAO 2009).Since 1994, landings of sparids (includingA. spinifer) have shown a general trend for increasing annual catches and in 2006, 6,185 tonnes of sparids (includingA. spinifer) were landed accounting for 16.5% of demersal fish landings in Omani waters (Al-Mamryet al.2009).TheArgyrops spiniferstock appears to be in a healthy condition in the Arabian Sea, as a wide range of size and age classes were caught in the hand-line (Al-Mamryet al.2009) and industrial trawl fisheries (McIlwainet al.2006). By comparison,A. spinifercaught in the trap-fishery in the southern Persian Gulf tend to be smaller (14–40 cm LT) and younger (under five years old) (Grandcourtet al.2004). However, this is probably a reflection of the fishing gear used, since fishing traps used in Omani coastal waters similarly catch smaller-sizedA. spinifer(25–45 cm LT) (Al-Mamry 2006).Valinassabet al.(2006) conducted a trawl survey in the Persian Gulf from 2003–2004 to assess the abundance of demersal fish resources in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.Argyrops spinifercontributed 1.36% of the total biomass from the Persian Gulf and 2.30% from the Oman Sea.Elsewhere in the Western Indian Ocean,Argyrops spiniferis found off Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal extending north to Kenya, butis not plentiful in these countries (Mann and Fennessy 2000).

In 2012, there was a slight increase to 13.7 tonnes (Marine Environment Research Center 2005, 2012).",stable,"Argyrops spiniferinhabits a wide range of bottoms in depths to 400 m (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004), usually occurring between five and 100 m (Sommer et al. 1996). The maximum size for this species is 75 cm (S. Alam, Ministry of Environment, pers. comm. 2013) but is more common to 30 cm TL (Sommer et al. 1996). The maximum age for A. spiniferisto 25 years with oldest fish being females (Al-Mamry et al. 2009). Young fish occur in very shallow waters of sheltered bays (Sommer et al. 1996) while larger individuals occur in deeper water. It feeds on benthic invertebrates, mainly molluscs (Fischer et al. 1990, Salini et al. 1994). The spawning season for A. spinifer in the Arabian Sea was observed to occur from September to January, immediately after the monsoon period, with a peak in spawning around October-November. In the southern Persian Gulf, spawning occurs from January to April(Grandcourt et al. 2004). McIlwain et al. (2006) suggested that there are two spawning seasons for A. spinifer in the Arabian Sea: a small peak in July during the monsoon season and a main spawning season between November and March. There is some evidence of large aggregations during autumn in the Gulf of Aden (Druzhinin 1975). The sizes at first maturity in Oman were 28.6 cm and 26.4 cm FL for A. spinifer females and males, respectively (McIlwain et al. 2006); these values were similar to results from the southern Persian Gulf, at 26.9 and 26.7 cm (Grandcourt et al.2004). Al-Mamry et al. (2009) report mean sizes at sexual maturity (L<sub>50</sub>) at 36.5 cm TL for males and 37.2 cm TL for females, respectively. The estimated mean ages at sexual maturity (A<sub>50</sub>) are 5.0 and 5.6 years for male and female fish respectively in Oman, but was 2.4 years for both males and females in the southern Persian Gulf (Grandcourt et al.2004).A comparison of the spawning period with that at which peaks in recruitment occur suggests that A. spinifer recruit to the trap fishery at ages between fuve and 11 months. There were high levels of juvenile retention because fish were fully recruited before the mean size at which sexual maturity occurred (Grandcourt et al. 2004).Parameter values of the von Bertalanffy growth function fitted to size at age data (males and females combined) were: k = 0.224 year<sup>−1</sup>, L∞ = 52.4 cm (LF), to = −0.44 years.Argyrops spiniferis fully exploited below the mean size at which females attained sexual maturity (26.9 cm LF). The overall sex ratio is significantly female biased although the bias was removed above the size at sexual maturation, potentially as a result of protogynous (female to male) sex change, although this has not been confirmed (Grandcourt et al. 2004). The von Bertalanffy growth parameters available for the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea indicate that A. spinifer in these regions have similar growth rates (i.e. k = 0.14–0.21 year<sup>-1</sup>) and attain a similar maximum size (Arabian Sea, L = 64.6 cm LT; Gulf of Aden, L = 63.5 cm LT)(Edwards et al.1985). The von Bertalanffy growth parameters available for the southern Persian Gulf provide contrasting results, with El-Sayed et al. (1998) reporting coefficients of k = 0.09 year<sup>-1</sup> and L = 81.0 cm LT in the early 1990s and Grandcourt et al. (2004) reporting coefficients of k = 0.22 year<sup>-1</sup> and L = 58.2 cm LT in 2000–2003. However, it is not known to what degree these differences in growth patterns are due to regional differences in biological productivity, stock-dependent genetic differences in growth performance, the selectivity in fishing gear used in each study and, in the case of the southern Persian Gulf, any temporal changes in fishing pressure (Grandcourt et al. 2004, Al-Mamry 2006).","The development of the fishing fleet of the United Arab Emirates in the southern Persian Gulf has raised concerns relating to the resource management implications.The exploitation rate for this species (0.407 per year) was comparable to that at the estimated safe harvest level (0.401 per year<sup></sup>), i.e. F<sub>0.1</sub>, suggesting thatArgyrops spiniferis exploited at a sustainable level. However, the high juvenile retention rate (66.9%) and the discrepancies between the mean sizes at first capture and those which would maximize yield per recruit, suggest that the existing mesh size regulations in the trap fishery need to be reviewed for this species in the southern Persian Gulf (Grandcourt et al. 2004).","There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this species. However, its distribution overlaps several marine protected areas within its range (World Database of Protected Areas, accessed 11 March 2014).","This species is caught mainly with bottom trawls, handlines and traps (Sommer et al. 1996). In the southern Persian Gulf they are caught using dome-shaped wire traps with a hexagonal mesh of approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. Traps are either fished individually or in strings by fibre glass dories and traditional wooden dhows(Grandcourtet al.2004). This species forms a small component of landings in the southern Persian Gulf : during 2002, 120 tonnes of A. spinifer were landed in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi(Grandcourtet al.2004).Argyrops spiniferis considered to be the most important sparid caught in the hand-line fishery in Omani coastal waters (Al-Mamry et al. 2009).Small numbers of A.spiniferare occasionally caught by recreational and commercial skiboats off Kwazulu-Natal (Mann et al.1997) and by lineboats in Mozambique, but theymake up a very small component of the catch in both areas (Maggs and Mann 2013). Relatively large catches are taken by bottom trawlers in the Gulf of Aden (Mann and Fennessy 2000). This species comprises a minor bycatch component of some commercial fisheries, such as prawn trawls in the Gulf of Carpentaria (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2014).Argyrops spiniferis occasionally caught by commercial fishers in Taiwan, including Penghu Island (Pescadores) by gill net, long-line and bottom trawler from five to 150 m in sandy-muddy bottoms (K. ShaoBiodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinicapers. comm. 2009).Argyrops spinifer is under consideration as a potential fish species for culture in Oman (Yoon et al.2013)."

(2014, 2016) used microsatellite makers to show that A. aequidens (sensu lato) included cryptic species – in particular with evidence of two southern African populations, one in South Africa and the other in Angola and Namibia. Subsequently, Song et al. (2017) demonstrated that global Atractoscion comprised four species and that A. aequidens was confined to southern/south-east Africa.","This endemic species occurs from the south coast of South Africa to northern Mozambique. It is moderately long-lived, attains a large size, and aggregates to spawn. It is commonly caught in recreational and commercial fisheries throughout its South African range. It has been recorded in semi-industrial linefish catches in Mozambique and likely features in small-scale fisheries there; it is actively targeted in South Africa, which is the only region for which population data exist. In South Africa the spawning biomass per recruit was reduced to ca. 5% of the pristine level in the 1990s, recovering slightly to around 10% by 2016. Catches of this species declined in the linefishery and the inshore trawl fishery (as a bycatch), and nominal CPUE in the commercial linefishery had dropped to 1.5-4.3% of historical values (1900s) by 1985-1998. The declines meet the criteria for placement into a threatened category; however, modelling of standardized CPUE data show no decline from the late 1980s until 2015. The substantial population reduction occurred prior to the three-generation (21 years) time period, and has remained at a very low level, with some signs of recovery. Since the population would likely decline if South African management regulations are removed, and given the heavy fishing pressure in Mozambique and its unknown status there, this species is listed as conservation dependent under the Near Threatened category. Rebuilding of the stock and monitoring of landings are priorities.","Atractoscion aequidens occurs from Cape Agulhas (South Africa), and eastward to northern Mozambique at Pinda (14.217°S, 40.767°E) where specimens were collected in 2009, and are lodged at the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; examined by Song et al. (2017). The depth range for this species is 15 to 200 m (Griffiths and Hecht 1995; Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data).","There are only population data for the South African component, which is significantly depleted and considered to be collapsed (Hutton et al. 2001,Winker et al. 2012, Kerwath and Winker 2013). Catches of this species have declined in the linefish and inshore trawl fisheries, and CPUE from 1985-1998 had dropped to 1.5-4.3% of historical values (early 1900s) (Griffiths 2000); catch per boat/year in the 1980s had declined to approximately 3% of the catches (of equivalent unit) in the 1990s (Hutton et al. 2001); the spawning biomass per recruit level (SBPR) was reduced by approximately 95% from pristine levels (Hutton et al. 2001). Total commercial catch along the South African coastline for the period 1985-1997 was 500 t per annum; landings declined from 397 t in 2001 to 248 t in 2016. Connell (2012) showed a possible decline in egg production since 2008 along the KwaZulu-Natal coast where spawning occurs. A modelling approach using standardized CPUE data based on Department of Fisheries commercial linefish records submitted by fishers was used to evaluate estimated and predicted trends in population size and this showed no overall decline since the late 1980s (see Supplementary data). There were area-based differences, with low catch rates persisting off the southern Cape, but with increases off the south-east coast (Donovan 2011, Winker et al. 2015); the low CPUE off the southern Cape could indicate that the increased CPUE levels on the south-east coast (Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal) may not persist. Boyd (2017) showed that overall SBPR had recovered slightly to around 10-11% of pristine levels, a possible consequence of management intervention to reduce fishing effort in 2003.There are no population data for this species in Mozambique waters which has a coastline of around 3,000 km (i.e. &gt; half the distributional range of this species), and virtually no readily-available records of its occurrence there, other than for the northern Mozambique specimens mentioned in Song et al. (2017), and a specimen reportedly observed in catch by a semi-industrial linefishing vessel in Mozambique (catch locality not known; Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data). There is heavy semi-industrial linefishing effort and extensive small-scale fishing by a variety of gear along this coast, but small-scale catch records focus on commonly-caught species, so there is no information on the extent of catches of A. aequidens by this sector.",stable,"Off the eastern coast of South Africa, this species undergoes well-defined migratory patterns. The migratory life history begins when adults migrate inshore from the Cape to KwaZulu-Natal on the east coast, where they spawn in the spring. They migrate back offshore dispersing over the Agulhas Bank during summer. Eggs and larvae are transported in a southwesterly direction by the inshore peripheral waters of the Agulhas Current. Juveniles spend one to two years in the southeast Cape nursery area before joining the sub-adult population in the southwest Cape. As sub-adults they remain in the southwest Cape for a further three to four years, moving inshore in summer and offshore in winter, until sexually mature. Some of the larger sub-adults (adolescents) undergo a partial adult migration (Griffiths and Hecht 1995).These are a schooling fish, at depths from 20-200 m (Griffiths and Hecht 1995; Oceanographic Research Institute, unpubl. data), found over coastal, continental shelf, and soft bottom habitats, although spawning adults are consistently found on wrecks and reefs off KwaZulu-Natal in winter.This species attains 50% sexual maturity at 90 cm fork length and at age 5 years (100% at 6 years) (Griffiths and Hecht 1995). It lives to at least nine years of age (Griffiths and Hecht 1995). This relatively late age and size at sexual maturity compared with other sciaenid species is not attributed to fishing pressure, although this species has been targeted in South Africa for more than a century, rather, it is suggested that it is an adaptation to a migratory life style (Griffiths and Hecht 1995). Generation length is therefore conservatively estimated at five to six years, and Winker et al. (2013, 2014) suggested seven years. This species can attain 130 cm total length (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004).Diets consists predominantly of particularly pilchard (Sardinops sagax)., as well as anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), and horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis).","The major threat to this species is overfishing and the South African stock is significantly depleted (Hutton et al. 2001). This species is particularly vulnerable to recruitment overfishing, because it is so commonly harvested prior to maturity (Hutton et al. 2001).It is targeted throughout its distribution range by commercial and recreational linefishers. Preliminary per recruit analyses indicated that the Geelbek stock was already over-exploited in 1985. Large quantities are caught by lineboats operating on the Agulhas Banks during the summer months. In KwaZulu-Natal, only adults are caught, primarily during their winter/spring spawning aggregation where they occur on well-known reefs; catches are mainly made at nightand landings are not monitored there. There is heavy fishing pressure in Mozambique but there is little information on catches of this species in this region.","In South Africa, historical catch restrictions included a daily bag limit of 10 fish day per person per day for recreational anglers (introduced in 1984) and a minimum size limit (60 cm TL) for both recreational and commercial fishers (Hutton et al. 2001).In order to address overfishing and to allow the depleted stocks to recover, a 50% reduction in commercial effort in the linefishery was implemented in 2003, and in 2005 a reduction in the bag limit to two fish per person per day for recreational fishers was implemented. In August 2019 several new large South African MPAs were promulgated which should offer some protection to this species; this includes a ban on night fishing in the MPAs, which is being contested by fishers.","This species is an important food fish throughout most of its distributional range. In South Africa, it is considered a premier commercial and recreational linefish species along the entire east coast (Cape Point to KwaZulu-Natal; Griffiths and Hecht 1995). It is ranked as the sixth most important commercial species in the linefishery of South Africa since it was started in the 1800s (Hutton et al. 2001)."

The sex ratio was close to 1:1. The total reported annual catch in Kane'ohe Bay was over 500 kg two times since 1966 and was usually less than 250 kg, while the unreported commercial and recreational catch could well be comparable with the reported catch. A total catch of 500 kg would represent about 30 to 60% of the estimated biomass for 1989 or 1990(Clarke 1996).Between 2001 and 2002, Paighambari and Daliri (2012) sampled shrimp trawl fisheries by-catch composition in the Bushehr province (Iranian waters). During the two fishing seasons,2.18 and 37.08 kg of this specieswere collected as by-catch, which comprised of 0.01 and 0.28% of the total catch, respectively. CPUE was determined to be 0.21 and 0.24 kg/h, respectively.Between 2009 and 2010, Hosseiniet al.(2012) conducted a study on the bycatch of the cutlassfish trawl fishery in Bushehr and Hormozgan waters. In Bushehr waters, this speciesoccurred in 2.5% of trawls and wasn't recorded in Hormozgan trawls.Chenet al.(2013) recorded between 11 and 100 kg of this specieswere collected as bycatch from September 2010 through January 2011 in Kuwait's shrimp trawl fishery, in which 0-1 kg were retained and the remain 10-100 kgwere discarded.This species comprised 1.03% of the catch composition of multiple hook and line in Lagonoy Gulf (July 1997 through June 2002) (Olañoet al.2009). This species is caught as bycatch in shrimp trawl and trap fisheries throughout the Persian Gulf, however, species-specific landings data are not available except in Abu Dhabi (J. Bishop, S.

It is an intra-Mediterranean migratory species.This species has been recently reported from central Brazil (Stein 2006), but no recent specimens have been collected from the north (Lessa and Fredou pers. comm. 2010) or south (Amorim pers. comm. 2010) of the country. However, there may have been misidentifications of this species with Auxis thazard.","Juvenile Auxis are the most abundant juvenile tunas in the world and they are widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters.FAO does not report statistics for this species as Auxis spp. catches are generally not identified to species. Worldwide reported landings for Auxis spp show a gradual increase from 22,278 tonnes in 1950 to 256,325 in 2006 (FAO 2009).In the Atlantic, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) includes statistics for Frigate Tuna (Auxis thazard), which are suspected to include both A. rochei and A. thazard. In the total catch of Frigate Tunas, the proportion of each of the two species is not known. However, almost all catches from Venezuela in the Atlantic and from countries in the Mediterranean are thought to be Auxis rochei (Collette and Nauen 1983). ICCAT estimates (ICCAT 2009) for A. rochei range from 12,000 t in 1990, to 2,600 t in 1999.In the Mediterranean, this is a common species in fisheries and abundance changes from place to place every year (Di Natale pers. comm. 2008). No assessment summary is given for this species from the Mediterranean. The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) is now starting a project to collect data on small tuna-like species in the Mediterranean (Di Natale pers. comm. 2008).In the 1980s there was a marked increase in reported landings of all small tuna species combined compared to previous years, reaching a peak of about 139,412 t in 1988. Reported landings for the 1989–1995 period decreased to approximately 92,637 t, and since then values have oscillated, with a minimum of 69,895 t in 1993 and a maximum of 123,600 t in 2005. Declared catches were 79,228 t in 2006 and 74,087 t in 2007. A preliminary estimate of the total nominal landings of small tunas in 2008 is 55,876 t. The 2008 preliminary catch of small tuna amounted to 55,876 t, of which 6,018 t was Bullet Tuna (STECF 2009). There are more than 10 species of small tunas, but only five of these account for about 88% of the total reported catch by weight. These five species are: Atlantic Bonito (Sarda sarda), Frigate Tuna (Auxis thazard) which may include some catches of Bullet Tuna (Auxis rochei), Little Tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), King Mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), and Atlantic Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) (ICCAT 2009).In the Indian Ocean, most of the catch of Frigate Tunas are A. thazard rather than this species.",stable,"This is a pelagic, oceanodromous species that forms schools. It is an off-shore predator feeding on whatever abundant resource is available with a preference for planktonic crustaceans, small cephalopods, and fish larvae. Among crustaceans, Hyperiidean amphipods are often the most important followed by a euphausiids (Mostarda et al. 2007). Because of their abundance, they are considered to be an important element of the food web, particularly as forage for other species of commercial interest.Longevity is five years, and males and females are of equal length. Adults can grow to 50 cm fork length (FL). Bullet Tuna mature at around two years old, or about 35 cm FL, but this can vary by region. Length at first maturity in the Philippines 17 cm FL, generally before one year of age. Length at 50% maturity of both sexes off India 24 cm and 18.8 cm in the Philippines (Yesaki and Arce 1994, Niiya 2001, Collette 2010). Age of first maturity in Japan is 1.25 years with a longevity of two years (Niiya 2001). Length at first maturity for females is 23.8 cm FL and 24 cm FL for males in India (Muthiah 1985).It is a multiple spawner with fecundity ranging between 31,000 and 103,000 eggs per spawning (according to the size of the fish). Larval studies indicate that Bullet Tuna spawn throughout its range (IOTC 2007). The spawning season varies from region to region at sea surface temperatures of 24°C or higher. In the Gulf of Mexico, peaks of batch spawning are reported from March to April, and from June to August while in coastal waters from Cape Hatteras to Cuba and in the Straits of Florida, spawning begins in February. Fecundity estimates range between 31,000 and 162,800 eggs per spawning correlated with the size of the female (Collette 2010).Maximum Size is 50 cm FL. The all-tackle gamefish record is of a 1.84-kg fish taken off L’Ampolla, Spain in 2004 (IGFA 2011).","This is a species with high regional commercial importance. It is caught by pole and line and as bycatch in a variety of gears including gill nets. It is also taken incidentally in artisanal purse seines. Since 1991, the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by tropical purse seiners may have led to an increase in fishing mortality of small tropical tuna species (STECF 2009). However here is a general lack of information on the mortality of these species as bycatch, exacerbated by the confusion regarding species identification (ICCAT 2009).In the Mediterranean Sea the price of this fish is low but quantity can be important in local markets. It is caught mostly by purse seine, set surface gill nets, and small drift nets (the later was banned in EU countries in 2002), hand and troll lines, and traps.In the Eastern Pacific, there are no major threats for this species. They are sometimes caught as bycatch in purse seines, but are discarded, but it is not known the amount that is caught.","There are no known conservation measures for this species. It is a highly migratory species, Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department, 1994). No fishery management plan currently in place except a prohibition on drift nets in EU countries.Data on the catch composition, biology and trends are now available from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, thanks to the ICCAT/GFCM joint expert group in 2008. More information, particularly on specific fishing effort, is needed from all areas. The small tuna fishery seems to be quite important for the coastal communities, both economically and as a source of proteins. The ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) suggests that countries be requested to submit all available data to ICCAT as soon as possible, in order to be used in future meetings. No management recommendations have been presented by ICCAT due to the lack of proper data, historical series and analyses. ICCAT/SCRS, in 2008, reiterated its recommendation to carry out studies to determine the state of these stocks and the adoption of management solutions. ICCAT-SCRS in 2009 noted that there is an improvement in the availability of catch and biological data for small tuna species particularly in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. However, biological information, catch and effort statistics for small tunas remain incomplete for many of the coastal and industrial fishing countries. Given that, many of these species are of high importance to coastal fishermen, especially in some developing countries, both economically and often as a primary source of proteins, therefore the SCRS recommends that further studies be conducted on small tuna species due to the limits of information available (STECF 2009).","This species is fished throughout its range, with high regional importance in some areas."

It is important in artisanal fisheries and is caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries, but landings are often mixed with Auxis rochei. It is listed as Least Concern.","This species is present in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. It is considered vagrant in the Mediterranean Sea. However, there are only a few records of this species in the Atlantic as most of the Auxis in the Atlantic are Auxis rochei.The Eastern Pacific population is recognized as a subspecies, Auxis thazard brachydorax (Collette and Aadland 1996), which occurs from California to the mouth of the Gulf of California to Peru, and all the oceanic islands except Clipperton (Robertson and Allen 2006).","This species (along with A. rochei) is considered to be extremely abundant in many parts of its range.FAO does not report statistics for this species. Auxis spp. catches are generally not identified to species. Worldwide reported landings for Auxis spp show a gradual increase from 22,278 t in 1950 to 256,325 t in 2006 (FAO 2009).In the Atlantic, most catches reported as A. thazard are probably A. rochei. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) includes statistics for Frigate Tuna (Auxis thazard) which are suspected to include both A. rochei and A. thazard. In the total catch of Frigate Tuna, the proportion of each of the two species is not known. Recent ICCAT estimates (ICCAT 2009) range from 21,000 (1987) to 3500 (2008) t. This species may be less abundant than A. rochei in the Atlantic.In the Mediterranean, this is a common species in fisheries and abundance changes from place to place every year (Di Natale pers. comm. 2008). No assessment summary is given for this species from the Mediterranean. The General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) is now starting a project to collect data on small tuna-like species in the Mediterranean (Di Natale pers. comm. 2008).In the 1980s there was a marked increase in reported landings of all small tuna species combined compared to previous years, reaching a peak of about 139,412 t in 1988. Reported landings for the 1989–1995 period decreased to approximately 92,637 t, and since then values have oscillated, with a minimum of 69,895 t in 1993 and a maximum of 123,600 t in 2005. Declared catches were 79,228 t in 2006 and 74,087 t in 2007. A preliminary estimate of the total nominal landings of small tunas in 2008 is 55,876 t. The 2008 preliminary catch of small tuna amounted to 55,876 t, of which 6,018 t was Bullet Tuna (Auxis rochei) (STECF 2009). There are more than 10 species of small tunas, but only five of these account for about 88% of the total reported catch by weight. These five species are: Atlantic Bonito (Sarda sarda), Frigate Tuna (Auxis thazard) which may include some catches of Bullet Tuna (Auxis rochei), Little Tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), King Mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), and Atlantic Spanish Mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) (ICCAT 2009).The catch for 2007 of this species in the Indian Ocean was 41,700 tonnes compared to 3,700 tonnes of A. rochei (IOTC 2007).",stable,"This is a pelagic, oceanodromous species that is also epipelagic in neritic and oceanic waters (Collette 1995). Adults are coastal or near-coastal, while juveniles are more widely spread throughout the world's ocean. It feeds on small fish, squids, planktonic crustaceans (megalops), and stomatopod larvae. Because of their abundance, they are considered an important element of the food web, particularly as forage for other species of commercial interest. It is preyed upon by larger fishes, including other tunas and billfishes.Longevity is approximately four years. The smallest maturing female off the west coast of Thailand was 31–33 cm fork length (FL), and the length at 50% maturity in the Gulf of Thailand was 34–37 cm FL (Yesaki and Arce 1994, Collette 2010). Length at maturity 50% is 30.5 cm FL in India (Muthiah 1985). Average estimated length-age relationships in the equatorial Atlantic are 22.9 cm at one year, 30.4 cm at two years, 36.7 cm at three years and 40.4 cm at four years (Grudtsev and Korolevich 1986).Fecundity estimates range from 78,000 to 1.37 million eggs in 31.5–44.2 cm females. In correlation with temperature and other environmental changes, the spawning season varies with areas, but in some places it may even extend throughout the year. In the southern Indian Ocean, spawning extends from August to April, north of the equator from January to April at sea surface temperatures of 24°C or higher (Klawe 1963, Collette 2010).Maximum Size is 62 cm FL. The all-tackle game fish record is of a 1.72 kg fish caught off Hat Head, New south Wales, Australia in 1998 (IGFA 2011).","This is a species with high commercial value. It is caught with beach seines, shore seines, drift nets, pursue seines, hook-and-line, gill nets and by trolling.Overall trends in the small tuna catch may mask declining trends for individual species because annual landings are often dominated by the landings of a single species. These fluctuations seem to be partly related to unreported catches, as these species generally comprise part of the bycatch and are often discarded, and therefore do not reflect the real catch. It is commonly believed that catches of small tunas are strongly affected by unreported or underreported data in all areas. Small tunas are exploited mainly by coastal fisheries and often by artisanal fisheries, although substantial catches are also made, either as target species or as bycatch, by purse seiners, mid-water trawlers, handlines, troll lines, driftnets, surface drifting long-lines and small scale gillnets. Several recreational fisheries also target small tunas. Since 1991, the use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by tropical purse seiners may have led to an increase in fishing mortality of small tropical tuna species (STECF 2009). There is a general lack of information on the mortality of these species as bycatch, exacerbated by the confusion regarding species identification (ICCAT 2009).","There are no known conservation measures for this species. It is a highly migratory species, Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department, 1994). No fishery management plan is currently in place except a prohibition on drift nets in EU countries.Data on the catch composition, biology and trends are now available from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, thanks to the ICCAT/GFCM joint expert group in 2008. More information, particularly on specific fishing effort, is needed from all areas. The small tuna fishery seems to be quite important for the coastal communities, both economically and as a source of proteins. The ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) suggests that countries be requested to submit all available data to ICCAT as soon as possible, in order to be used in future meetings. No management recommendations have been presented by ICCAT due to the lack of proper data, historical series and analyses. ICCAT/SCRS, in 2008, reiterated its recommendation to carry out studies to determine the state of these stocks and the adoption of management solutions. ICCAT-SCRS in 2009 noted that there is an improvement in the availability of catch and biological data for small tuna species particularly in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. However, biological information, catch and effort statistics for small tunas remain incomplete for many of the coastal and industrial fishing countries. Given that, many of these species are of high importance to coastal fishermen, especially in some developing countries, both economically and often as a primary source of proteins, therefore the SCRS recommends that further studies be conducted on small tuna species due to the limits of information available (STECF 2009).",This species is fished throughout its range.

It is commercially exploited by deep-water trawl operations especially over seamounts throughout its range, which may also be causing damage to the habitat. There are some seamounts in the Atlantic that are protected from trawling. It is not commercially exploited where it ranges in West Africa and therefore, there are no major threats. However, if a fishery were to begin then it should be carefully managed.This species is listed as Least Concern.","Global: Beryx decadactylus is distributed circumgloballyfrom 70°N-45°Sin tropical and temperate zonesin the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans from 150-1,000 m depth (usually deeper than 200 m).

Eastern Central Atlantic: This species is known from the African coast in the eastern Atlanticoff of Morocco south to Sierra Leone, including the islands of the Azores, Great Meteor Seamount, Madeira and Canary Islands (Moore in press, Mundy 2005).In a trawl survey conducted off the northwest coast of Africa between the years 1962-1973,B. decadactyluswas captured between the Canary Islands (27°34'N)and Cape Garnet (25°07'N) from 350-600 m depth (Maurin and Quero 1982).

It can occur in localized aggregations (Moore in press). In a trawl survey conducted off the northwestern African coast between the years 1962-1973, a total of 72 specimens of B. decadactylus were captured between theCanary Islands and Cape Garnet with the largest catch occurring off of Western Sahara. This small catch size is indicative of the rare occurrence of this species in the region.It is speculated that high catch rates in 1962 (n=72) caused a serious decline in the local population as evidenced by comparatively low catch rates in subsequent survey years (n=3 in 1968, n=0 in 1971, n=6 in 1973 where the number of stations sampled was doubled) (Maurin and Quero 1982). It is experiencing a probable population decline in the southwestern Indian Ocean off of La Reunion Island due to commercial fishery exploitation and bycatch (Frickeet al.2009). A genetics study that compared samples of B. decadactylus from the Azores Archipelago and the Charleston Bump off the southeastern United States found evidence for transatlantic gene flow between the two localities (Friess and Sedberry 2011).This species frequently occurred in a trawl survey off the Cape Verde Islands (Menezeset al.2004). It is locally abundant in Trinidad.",unknown,"Eastern Central Atlantic:Beryx decadactylusis a benthopelagic species with a maximum size of 43cm SL, but commonly caught to 35cm. This species forms aggregations over the continental shelf and slope, and commonly near seamounts where it vertically migrates to shallower water at night. It feeds on fish, crustaceans and squid (Moore in press). It prefers sand and mud bottoms (Fricke et al. 2009). Vakilyet al. (2002) describes B. decadactylusas bathydemersal with a maximum size of 100 cm TL off of West Africa. More research has been carried out on B. splendens, a very similar species and is often applied to refer to B. decadactylus (Aboim 2005). In a diet study conducted in the Canary Islands, B. decadactylus and B. splendensmainlyfed on small fishes, crustaceans and cephalopods (Durr and Gonzalez 2002). Similar results were found in a diet study conducted off the southeastern United States on the Charleston Bump (Goldman and Sedberry 2011). In a deep-sea submersible survey conducted on the Cape Fear coral mound off North Carolina, this species was strongly associated with high-profile hard coral habitat on the reef crest with moderate to high percentages of live coral cover (Quattrini et al. 2012).In a survey conducted off the Cape Verde Islands, this species ranged in size from 25-47 cm FL (Pereira et al. 2012).In a longline groundfish survey conducted off the Azores archipelago, this species ranged in size from 20-55 cm FL (Rosaet al. 2006).In a study conducted in the Azores Archipelago,B. decadactylusfemaleshad a size at first maturity of 32.5 cm FL and males at 30.3 cm FL and both sexes had an age at first maturity of four years (Estacio et al. 2001). In a study conducted on larval samples of B. splendens and B. decadactylus from the Southeast Hancock Seamount in the central North Pacific Ocean, size at flexion was 3.7-6 mm SL and juveniles were greater than 15mm SL, spawning season was in the summer, and samples were collected from zero to 50 m, but with the greatest amount less than 25 m depth (Mundy 1990). In a study conducted off the southeastern coast of the United States, mature specimens of B. decadactylus ranged from 41-63 cm FL, females were ripe between June through September and males were reproductively active year-round, estimated ages ranged from eight to 69 years (validated with radiometric dating) with a minimum lifespan of 49 years, and natural mortality was estimated at 0.06 per year (Friess and Sedberry 2011). Results from an age and growth study conducted on this species off the Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands showed that B. decadactylus is slow-growing and capable of reaching an age of at least 11 years old (Krug et al. 2010).In Trinidad, this species is benthopelagic, found in rocky bottoms and deep coral reefs. It is frequently associated with seamounts and at night it often rises from the bottom and aggregates on seamounts. Maximum size is 43 cm SL and it feeds on fishes, crustaceans and cephalopods. It is locally abundant and possible has schooling behaviour.","Beryx decadactylusis a highly regarded foodfish targeted by deep-water trawl and longline fisheries that are widespread throughout the eastern Atlantic and elsewhere (Moore in press). In a trawl survey conducted off the northwest African coast between 1962-1973, 72 specimens of B. decadactylus were captured. It is speculated that high catch rates in 1962 (n=72)<span class='apple-converted-space'>caused a serious decline in the local population as evidenced by comparatively low catch rates in subsequent survey years (n=3 in 1968, n=0 in 1971, n=6 in 1973 where the number of stations sampled was doubled).This study should serve as an example of the extreme consequences that even a small amount offishingcan have forthis species. Despite a doubling of the number of sampling stations,B. decadactylusdid not experience a population recovery during the eleven years that elapsed between 1962 and 1973 (Maurin and Quero 1982). It is considered sensitive to human activities and is experiencing a probable population decline in the southwestern Indian Ocean off of La Reunion Island due to commercial fishery exploitation and bycatch (Frickeet al.2009). Recent data collected from a study off the southeastern coast of the United States shows that this species is long-lived and vulnerable to overfishing (Friess and Sedberry 2011).The North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) recognizes that demersal fisheries on theCorner Rising, Orphan Knoll, Newfoundland, and New England Seamounts which targetBeryx splendens, where B. decadactylus occurs as bycatch, have been experiencingsignificant declines in catch levels since the 1970s, likely due to the fishery being unsustainable (Kulkaet al. 2007).Beryx species may experience increased threats from overexploitation due to their aggregating behaviour. Further study is needed on the connectivity of subpopulations between seamounts in order to determine the rate of recolonization of a seamount following fishing activity (Norseet al.2012). Deep-sea corals are often damaged by trawling operations. This may result in habitat loss forBeryx species in part of their range (Reed and Ross 2005).<span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'>","Beryx decadactylusis designated Data Deficient and a medium priority for conservation action byFrickeet al.(2009) in the southwestern Indian Ocean off of La Reunion. In 2006, the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) closed areas of theCorner Rising, Orphan Knoll, Newfoundland and New England Seamounts to demersal fishing where the main target species is Beryx splendens, but includes B. decadactylus as bycatch. This action was taken after concerns that significant declines in catch levels since the 1970s was likely due to the fishery being unsustainable (Kulka et al. 2007). It has been reported fromthe deep-water coral reef off of the southeastern United States which hasbeen partially protected since 1984, and was expanded in 2000. Since then, Norway and Nova Scotia have established MPAs to protect deep-water Lophelia coral reefs in their waters (Reed and Ross 2005).","In the Eastern Central Atlantic, Beryx decadactylus is a highly regarded foodfish targeted by deep-water trawl and longline fisheries that are widespread throughout the eastern Atlantic and elsewhere (Moore in press). It is often targeted by seamount fisheries (Morato et al. 2006). In the western central Atlantic FAO guide, this species is described as commercially valuable in many areas throughout the world, including Madeira and the Indian Ocean where it is caught in longline and trawl fisheries (Paxton 2002). Beryx decadactylus and B. splendens were both targeted by a deep-water longline fishery off of northwest Spain in the 1990s (Pinheiro et al. 1998).Beryx splendensandB. decadactylusoccur as bycatch inthe Spanish bottom-longline fleet that has been targeting hakes (Merluccius senegalensis and M. polli) since the 1990soff of Mauritania (Ramos et al. 2001). This species is not utilized off the Cape Verdes(Vanda Marques Monteiro pers. comm. 2013) or off Mauritania (Camara pers. comm. 2013).As reported in 1959, this species is/was targeted from the fall to spring seasons by hook and line in Sagami Bay, Japan (Abe 1959).Beryx decadactylus is considered commercially valuable in the waters off of La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean (Bertrand et al. 2012).Off the Canary Islands, bothB. splendensandB. decadactylusare captured via handlines and bottom drop lines in a commercial artisanal fishery (Durr and Gonzalez 2002).Off the Atlantic coast of thesoutheasternUnited States this species occurs in small numbers as bycatch in the Wreckfish (Polyprion americanus) fishery (Friess and Sedberry 2011).It is normally captured as bycatch in the demersal fishery forBeryx splendensin the Azores Archipelago, however, fisheries statistics lump these twoBeryx species together. There is some concern thatB. decadactylusmay be more susceptible to overfishing due to smaller subpopulations and more conservative life history thanB. splendens(Aboim 2005). The Azorean landings ofBeryx species were relatively higher in 1993-2003 than in 2004-2009 (Menezeset al.2013).Beryx species are described as being heavily exploited on seamounts in the Azorean Archipelago between 1992-2002 (ICES Report 2002). There is concern about sequential depletion and underreporting in commercial fisheries from international waters and data was considered insufficient to complete an assessment in 2003 (ICES Report 2004). The following are the catch data from ICES Report 2004 for B. splendens andB. decadactylus- Total landings (tonnes):1988-122,103,225; 1989 - 113,147,260; 1990 - 137,201,339; 1991 - 203,168,371; 1992 - 274,176,450; 1993 - 317,217,533; 1994 - 404,231,636; 1995 - 335,194,529; 1996 - 379,171,550; 1997 - 268,111,378; 1998 - 161,68,229; 1999 - 119,56,175; 2000 - 172,372,09; 2001 - 182,17,199; 2002 - 223,202,42; 2003 - 150,221,72.It is not marked in the west Atlantic."

This species was also recently recorded from the Galápagos Islands (Acuña-Marrero and Salinas de Léon 2013). The depth range for this species is 10 to 188 m (Mundy 2005).","This species is abundant in all marine habitats within its range (Smith-Vaniz 1984). This speciesis one of the most abundant and frequently encountered species of large carangids in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Hobson 1984, DeMartini and Parrish1996, Friedlander and DeMartini 2002).Numbers of this specieshave been depleted in populated areas but remains abundant throughout remotes atolls and reefs of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument (Shomura 1987, Sudekum et al. 1991, Friedlander and DeMartini 2002, DeMartiniet al.2005). This species was one of the most common species (8.5%) of 401 carangids caught during three annual one-day fishing tournaments at coastal bay in Hawaii and predominated in catches within the sheltered embayment(Meyeret al.2007). In the later part of the 20th century, the commercial demand for this species declined substantially. Catch per unit effort forthis speciesincreased in the 1980s but was followed by decline in the 1990s. Average size of the catch of this species showed a declining trend until the late 1980s after which the trend increases (Friedlander and Dalzell 2004). In the Hawaii recreational catch, it is still one of the most frequently caught species and is highly sought after by sport fishermen (I. Williams pers. comm. 20150).In fisheries independent surveys conducted between 2008 and 2012,this specieshad a mean density of 0.9/ha in Fiji (S. Jupiter, unpublished data). In the Federated States of Micronesia, it was recorded in Guam, Ifalik and Satawal but at relatively low densities (0.4 to 0.8/ha) (B. Taylor, unpublished data). In the Solomon Islands, surveys around the populous islands showed a mean density of 1.8 /ha, and surveys around the remote islands showed a mean density of 2.0 /ha (A. Green, unpublished data). This species was not recorded at Raja Ampat (A. Green, unpublished data).In NOAA surveys of fish densities in Oceania, taken from between 2009 and 2012,this specieswas infrequentlyobserved during surveys in all regions other than the northwestern Hawaiian Islands where they are extremely abundant (mean density all islands of 31.8/ha) (NOAA, unpublished data). However, northwestern Hawaiian Island density estimates are undoubtedly inflated due to ‘mobbing’ behavior(attraction to and aggregation around divers)of this species (Parrish et al. 2000).In 2005, 77.5 tonnes ofthis species(1.2% of the total species composition)were collected by the Abu Dhabi Emirate fisheries. Catch totals peaked in 2009 with 105.8 tonnes, but followed by a decrease to 7.0 tonnes in 2012 (Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi 2006, 2010,2013).In 1986, 50 tonnes ofthis specieswere harvested in the Persian Gulf. Catch totals gradually increased, with some fluctuations, to a peak of 7,268 tonnes in 2005. Following 2005, catch totals decreased to 4,435 tonnes in 2009. In 2011, 5,178 tonnes were collected.In 1982, 74 tonnes ofthis specieswere harvested globally. Catch totals gradually increased, with some fluctuations, to 222 tonnes in 1996. A substantial increase to 4,704 tonnes occurred in 1997, when Iran began to harvest this species. Catch totals continued to increase to 11,414 tonnes in 2011. This speciesconstitutes 10% of the total carangid production in the Tuticorin region of India from 2001 through 2006 (Abdussamad et al. 2008).",unknown,"This speciesis pelagic and occur to depths exceeding 100 m (Wetherbeeet al.2004).This speciesoccurs in many habitats, including rock, coral reef channels, inner reefs, and seaward reefs (Lieske and Myers 1994, Mundy 2005).This speciesis also found over sand flats inshore. This species is a facultative schooling species (Major 1978) with adultssolitary or in schools.Juveniles occur in small schools over sandy inshore bottoms (Myers 1999) and occasionally in turbid estuaries (Blaberand Cyrus1983). Wide tolerance of salinity has been observed in juveniles and subadults (Blaber and Cyrus1983). However, the presence of estuarine habitat isn't necessary for this speciesto thrive, as observed by Sudekumet al.(1991) in the NW islands of Hawaii where this speciesoccurs in high abundance, but estuarine habitat is absent.This speciesfeeds during the day, mostly on demersal and pelagic fishes.This speciesalso consumes cephalopods and crustaceans (Blaberand Cyprus1983,Sudekumet al.1991).This speciesis one of the largest of the carangid fishes, measuring up to 170 cm total length (Lieske and Myers 1994). The world angling record (IGFA) is 66 kg (Smith-Vaniz 1984), and the largest published weight for this species is 86.6 kg (Murakami et al. 2007). This species can live to at least 20 years of age and has been recorded to 30 years of age in captivity (Friedlander and Dalzell 2004). Sudekumet al.(1991)determined females of this speciesreach maturity at approximately 60 cm (SL) and 3-4 years of age. However, Tharwat and Al-Gaber (2006) observed maturity to occur around is 37 cm in length (sex unknown).This speciesforms spawning aggregations which havebeen observed on shallow seaward reefs and offshore banks (Sudekum et al. 1991, de Silvaet al.2014). Spawning takes place during the summer months (peak May-August) in Hawaii (Friedlanderand Dalzell 2004,Meyer et al.2007).In Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, juveniles less than 20 cm, occurred on the murky lagoon floor (Wetherbee et al.2004). When juveniles reached 25 to 40 cm in length, they moved to the lagoonal patch reefs. Once larger than 40 cm, juveniles and subadults moved outside of the bay.","This species has experienced declines in more human-populated areas in some parts of its range due to fishing (DeMartini et al. 2002,Meyer et al. 2007). This species is relatively long-lived and has a large maximum body size, which may make it more sensitive to fishing pressure. However, significant global population declines have not yet been observed and are not suspected due to exploitation.","The range of this species overlaps with a number of marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP 2014). Small marine protected areas were found to be too small to effectively protect adults of this species (Meyer et al. 2007).This species is managed by a number of size and bag limits. In Hawaii, the minimum landing size of 10 inches and 16 inches (for sale) and there is a bag limit of 20 fish (Accessed through Fin Talk portal, 2014-10).","This species is extensively targeted by anglers (Murakami et al. 2007). This speciesis an important harvested commercial and recreational fish in the Persian Gulf and throughout most of the rest of its distribution (Smith-Vaniz 1984). This speciesis caught with hook and line, spearfishing, traps and gillnets (Smith-Vaniz 1984, Carpenteret al.1997).This speciesis marketed fresh and dried salted (Smith-Vaniz 1984).In Hawaii, this species is regularly taken by casting recreational fisherman for sport and to satisfy local demand. It is rarely targeted for food due to health fears of ciguatera poisoning (I. Williams pers. comm. 2015). This species is also taken by two traditional Hawaiian fishing methods: Kukui (stout wooden pole with thick; three-ply olona cord, baited with moray eel (Reichel 1993); Pahoe method (canoe and trailing bait with a bundle of mashed wood) (Friedlander and Dalzell 2004). It is estimated that the value of recreational fishing for thisspecies amounts to about USD 31 million annually and was shown to be by far the most targeted species (35%) by recreational anglers in a 1996 survey, followed by Mahi Mahi and tuna (Gaffney 2000)."

It is a large, slow-growing species with an estimated generation length of 22 years. The Silvertip Shark is subjected to high bycatch levels in high seas fisheries and in artisanal longline, gillnet, and trawl fisheries throughout its range, with its meat and fins marketable. Surveys of fish markets in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea suggest that the Silvertip Shark has undergone large declines in those waters. There is evidence that Indonesian fisheries have considerably reduced the numbers of the Silvertip Shark within the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] 1974 Box in the Timor Sea. Catches of sharks in this area declined throughout the early 1990s to the level that Indonesian shark fishing vessels have become relatively uncommon. In the Indian Ocean there was an estimated decline in the abundance of several reef shark species (including the Silvertip Shark) of over 90% in the period between 1970 and 2006 and around the US Pacific Islands common reef sharks have declined to 3-10% of baseline levels. This species' site-specificity, patchy population, and life history characteristics indicate that remote populations that are not currently managed are highly susceptible to depletion from direct shark fisheries and illegal practices. This information, combined with actual and potential levels of exploitation throughout its range results in a global assessment of Vulnerable, based on suspected overall population decline of greater than 30% over three generations (66 years) inferred from survey data. This assessment should be revisited when reliable catch data become available. In Australia, catch and survey data from the Great Barrier Reef suggest that this species is fairly common. The Silky Shark has limited interaction with fisheries operating in tropical Queensland and the Northern Territory an therefore, the species is listed as Least Concern in the regional Australian assessment.","The Silvertip Shark has a tropical Indo-Pacific distribution that is wide-ranging but fragmented (Ebert et al. 2013). In the Western Indian Ocean, the Silvertip Shark occurs in the Red Sea, off South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Madagascar, Aldabra Islands, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Chagos Archipelago (Ebert et al. 2013). In the Western Central Pacific, it occurs off Indonesia, Taiwan, Guam, New Caledonia, Philippines, Palau, Marshall, Solomon and Phoenix Islands, Tahiti, Tuvalu, and Papua New Guinea (Ebert et al. 2013). It also occurs in northern Australian waters from Carnarvon (Western Australia) to Bundaberg (Queensland), except for the Gulf of Carpentaria and Arafura Sea (Jones et al. 1991, MIRC 2007, Last and Stevens 2009). In the Eastern Central Pacific, the Silvertip Shark is known from southern Baja California, south to Guatemala and Colombia, including the Revillagigedo and Clipperton Islands, Cocos Island and Galápagos Islands (Ebert et al. 2013). The species possibly also occurs in the Western Central Atlantic (Mexico, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea; Ebert et al. 2013), although its presence in that region is unconfirmed (Grace 2001).","The Silvertip Shark population appears to be fragmented, with apparently low potential for interchange between localised stocks. Surveys of fish markets in Indonesia and Papua Guinea suggest that the Silvertip Shark has undergone large population declines in those waters (W. White, CSIRO, 02/2015, pers. comm). For example, a five-year survey of Indonesian fish landing sites only found 95 Silvertip Shark individuals out of a total of more than 21,000 sharks recorded (White 2007). Based on diving survey data, Graham et al. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks observed per dive in Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a decline of over 90% across 36 years. Species-specific data only included the period from 1996 to 2006, in which the mean number of the Silvertip Shark observed per dive actually increased from 0.03 sharks per dive to 0.12 (Graham et al. 2010). However, underwater surveys conducted between 2004 and 2010 across a much broader area of the Central Western Pacific Ocean, that is, around 46 United States Pacific Islands, estimated that common reef sharks have declined to 3-10% of baseline levels around inhabited islands (Nadon et al. 2012). Baseline was considered to be the absence of humans (Nadon et al. 2012) and theoretically could be considered to be at least three generation lengths of Silvertip Sharks (66 years). Given this large decline in the abundance of reef shark species around inhabited islands and the high exploitation levels from fisheries operating in the Indo-Pacific region, it is suspected that the Silvertip Shark have experienced population reductions of more than 30% across the Indo-Pacific Ocean over three generations.",decreasing,"The Silvertip Shark occurs on the continental shelf, offshore islands, coral reefs, and offshore banks, from surface waters to depths of 600-800 m (Compagno et al. 2005). It is also found inside lagoons, near drop-offs, and offshore (Compagno et al. 2005).The species appears to be relatively site-specific for long periods with limited dispersion, particularly at remote and isolated coral reef habitats around tropical islands or atolls (Barnettet al. 2012, Espinozaet al. 2015). On the continental shelf, larger individuals of the species tend to be more mobile and use larger areas than other common reef shark species (Barnettet al. 2012, Espinozaet al. 2015). The Silvertip Shark also exhibits strong diel behaviour, moving closer to coral reefs and using shallower habitats at night.Reproduction is viviparous, with a yolk sac placenta (Compagno et al. 2005, White et al. 2006, White 2007). Females give birth to 1-11 pups per litter (average six) biennially, after a 12 month gestation period (Compagno et al. 2005, White et al. 2006,Last and Stevens 2009). Size at birth is reported at 63-68 cm total length (TL) (Compagno et al. 2005) and 73-81 cm TL (White et al. 2006). Young are found in shallow water closer to shore, whereas adults are more wide-ranging (Compagno et al. 2005).Compagno et al. (2005) report that males mature at 160-180 cm TL and females at 160-199 cm TL. White et al. (2006) report that males mature at 190-200 cm TL and females at ~195 cm TL.Growth appears to be fairly slow at about 9 cm per year for juveniles (Last and Stevens 2009). It reaches a maximum size of 300 cm TL (Compagnoet al. 2005). No estimate of generation length is available for the species, although it can be inferred from its congener, the Pigeye Shark (C. amboinensis), which has a similar maximum size and an estimated generation length of 21.5 years (Tillett et al. 2011).","The Silvertip Shark is a bycatch in high seas fisheries and in artisanal longline, gillnet, and trawl fisheries throughout its range. The number of pelagic sharks landed by fishing fleets in all oceans has increased in economic importance (Mejuto et al. 2006). However, catch statistics are generally not available (Holts 1988, Smith et al. 1998) and where they are, they are under-reported. The Silvertip Shark is one of the nine main species landed by high seas longline and net fleets. The majority of these fleets target tunas in all of the world's oceans and as a result have a large bycatch of pelagic sharks (Fowler et al. 2005); for example, the species is a known bycatch of western Pacific tuna fleets (Ward et al. 2004). The Silvertip Shark was not considered in Clarke et al.'s (2006a) analysis of the global shark fin trade, although fins of the species have been identified in the trade (Clarke et al. 2006b).Coral reef-associated species such as the Silvertip Shark are important to fisheries in Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, the Maldives, and Chagos Archipelago (500 km south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean), where reefs dominate coastal habitats (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). In this region elasmobranchs are most commonly taken as bycatch in non-target fisheries or catchall artisanal fisheries (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Finning and discarding of carcasses has been reported, especially in offshore and high seas fisheries targeting tuna (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). The Silvertip Shark from the Chagos Archipelago is taken by the Mauritian Inshore Fishery, which targets grouper (subfamily Epinephelinae) and the Deepwater Snapper (Etelis carbunculus) and has operated in these waters since the early 1970s (Mees 1996). There is also an open-water fishery targeting tuna that commonly catches reef-associated sharks incidentally (Graham et al. 2010). Despite conservation measures in place in the Chagos Archipelago (see the Conservation section), illegal fishing is suspected to be a common activity in remote locations.The Silvertip Shark is landed in local markets in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, and the Philippines (Kumoru 2003, SEAFDEC 2006, White 2007). In the Philippines, it is in the top 10 most landed species by number (0.73%) and weight (2.6%) with individuals ranging in size from 210-240 cm TL and averaging 23 kg in weight (SEAFDEC 2006). In Papua New Guinea, the Silvertip Shark was taken in the longline shark fishery that operated close to seamounts and non-emergent reefs (Kumoru 2003). Based on observer data, the Silky Shark (C. falciformis) and the Oceanic Whitetip Shark (C. longimanus) dominated the shark catch (58%), but the Silvertip Shark (6.2%) was also taken in significant numbers (Kumoru 2003). Most Silvertip Shark individuals caught in this fishery were retained (88%) and the fins and meat marketable (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the Western and Central Pacifc Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark.There is evidence from northern Australia that finning can cause localised depletion of shark populations. Remote populations of Silky Shark are likely highly sensitive to target fisheries for meat or fins, particularly given their limited dispersal and localised movement patterns (Barnett et al. 2012). Acoustic and baited camera survey techniques were used to census shark abundance at two northern Australian reefs: Mermaid Reef in Rowley Shoals (a Commonwealth Marine Protected Area closed to all fishing) and Scott Reef (within the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] 1974 Box in the Timor Sea, where access by Indonesian fishers using traditional artisanal fishing techniques is permitted). Shark abundance was an order of magnitude higher on Mermaid Reef (Meekan and Cappo 2004). The Silvertip Shark, the main target of shark finning fleets in this area, was common on Mermaid Reef and absent at Scott Reef (Meekan and Cappo 2004). Fishing pressure is the most plausible explanation for differences in the composition and abundance of shark assemblages between Mermaid and Scott Reefs. Sharks preferentially targeted by fishermen, such as hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.) and the Silvertip Shark were absent from counts at Scott Reef. Furthermore, catches of reef sharks in the local area (MOU74 Box) declined throughout the early 1990s to the point that Indonesian shark fishing vessels have become relatively uncommon in this area (Wallner and McLoughlin 1996, Fox and Sen 2002, Ruppert et al. 2013). Several initiatives are underway to identify which species are being taken and in what quantities.In the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Queensland, Australia, the Silvertip Shark is not targeted by fisheries, but very low numbers are taken incidentally by commercial and recreational line fisheries that target Coral Trout (Plectropomus leopardus; Heupel et al. 2009). This may be a result of its strong diel and foraging behaviours around coral reefs at night when little fishing activity occurs (Espinoza et al. 2015). Conversely, poor reporting of species-specific shark landings may occur (Heupel et al. 2009), a common pattern observed in many fisheries where untargeted elasmobranch bycatch typically goes unidentified and/or unreported (Walsh et al. 2002). In addition, although most of the shark catch associated with the Coral Trout line fishery is not retained, sharks that interact with line fisheries may break off before landing or are released bearing hooks and traces, and it is unclear how this may affect the health and survival of Silvertip Sharks (Gallagher et al. 2014). However, catch-per-unit effort data from the period between 1989 and 2006 showed no evidence of increase or decline of sharks associated with the line fishery along the GBR (Heupel et al. 2009). The Silvertip Shark is not known to interact with the inshore gillnet fishery that operates in Queensland waters (Harry et al. 2011).A ten-year survey (2000–2010) using baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire GBR showed that the Silvertip Shark was the second most commonly sighted species (12.2%) (Espinoza et al. 2014). This survey showed that the species is restricted to offshore coral reef habitats in the GBR. An examination of the GBR Marine Park Zoning showed higher abundances of the Silvertip Shark in reefs that were closed to fishing. Moreover, higher abundances of the species were observed in protected areas that had more and healthier coral cover, suggesting that the loss and degradation of coral reefs may negatively affect their populations (Espinoza et al. 2014). BRUVS data from 2004-2010 suggest that the abundance of the Silvertip Shark has not changed since the new re-zoning of the GBR Marine Park in 2004, despite an increase in the coverage of protected areas (Espinoza et al. 2014).","Currently there are no species-specific management measures in place.In the Chagos Archipelago, since 2006 all fishing vessels were required to report shark bycatch, finning practices were banned, and the use of wire trace was prohibited. There was also a British Indian Ocean Patrol Vessel patrolling this Archipelago to detect illegal shark fisheries, mainly from Sri Lanka (Andersonet al. 1998). However, illegal fisheries still operate in these areas as these measures are largely unenforced. Catch levels should be quantified and monitored throughout the range of the species. Silvertip Shark populations in isolated coral reef habitats subject to fishing pressure may benefit from creation of Marine Protected Areas, because their limited dispersal from those habitats likely makes them more susceptible to depletion (Compagnoet al.2005, Barnett et al. 2012). Enforcement of regulations related to fisheries catch and landings, such as finning regulations and size limits, would be the most beneficial conservation measure for the species.","The Silvertip Shark is utilized for its fins, meat, cartilage, liver, teeth, jaws, and skin (SEAFDEC 2006).The meat, teeth, and jaws are generally sold locally, whereas fins, skin, and cartilage are generally exported."

The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 59.2% over three generation lengths (44 years). Therefore, the Grey Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Grey Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-West and Central Pacific Oceans, and also occur in some parts of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (Last and Stevens 2009).","Genetic and telemetry studies support an isolation by distance model of population structure (Espinoza et al. 2015, Momigliano et al. 2017) that result in significant structuring in the population. A lack of sampling throughout its range means the number and boundaries of these populations cannot yet be determined. There are numerous accounts of population trends for individual locations throughout its range. Many of these accounts have demonstrated substantial declines in abundance. This includes Chagos Archipelago where Graham et al. (2010) estimated that the reef shark population, including Grey Reef Sharks, had declined by 90% between 1976 and 2005 based on diver surveys. However, Ferretti et al. (2018) reconstructed shark populations at this location and concluded that Grey Reef Sharks had in fact recovered at this location to be at 79% of their original abundance. In the Pacific Ocean, Nadon et al. (2012) used manta tow data from 15 locations and found that Grey Reef Shark populations far from human populations (Jarvis Reef, Phoenix Islands, Line Islands, Johnston Atoll, Wake Island, Northwest Hawaiian Islands and western and northern Mariana Islands) were close to their carrying capacity, while those close to human populations (Hawaii (main islands), American Samoa and southern Mariana Islands) were heavily depleted (&lt;3% of carrying capacity). On Australia's Great Barrier Reef there are varying reports of population decline and recovery. Robbins et al. (2006) reported that Grey Reef Sharks were suffering from ongoing collapse, with annual declines of between 7 and 17%. However, subsequent research has shown that populations have not declined as dramatically as first estimated (Heupel et al. 2009), and Espinoza et al. (2014) demonstrating that rezoning of the reef had led to increasing abundance in areas protected from fishing.To account for differences in the trends of Grey Reef Sharks between locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range. This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimated depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef-level depletion estimates were aggregated, weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area), to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Grey Reef Sharks was estimated as 59.2% (standard error 51.9–66.5%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (434 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded, based on the Global Finprint data that the Grey Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% in the last three generation lengths (44 years).",decreasing,"The Grey Reef Shark is found in clear tropical waters from the surface to depths of around 280 m (Last and Stevens 2009) and is common around coral reefs, particularly near drop-offs and fringing coral reefs. Its distribution is patchy in continental shelf waters. It attains a maximum size of 255 cm total length (TL), males mature at 110–145 cm TL and females mature at 120–142 cm TL (Wetherbeeet al. 1997,Ebertet al.2013). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 1–6 pups, a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 48–49 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Last and Stevens 2009, Wetherbeeet al. 1997).Smart et al. (2016) provide age data from Papua New Guinea where the females mature at 9 years, and Robbins et al. (2006) showed they reach a maximum age of at least 20 years on the Great Barrier Reef. Based on these data, generation length is estimated to be 14.5 years.","The Grey Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scalelongline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. There is little species specific information on catches. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. However, it is occasionally taken in industrial scale fisheries. For example, Grey Reef Shark made up 4.2% (by number) of the sharks caught by the Papua New Guinea Shark Longline Fishery, making it the second most commonly caught species (White et al. 2020). The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries.In Indonesia it makes up 0.1% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter et al. In press).While in Fiji, Grey Reef Shark makes up 6.3% (by number) of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus et al. 2015). In many parts of east Africa, and south and southeast Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza et al. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon et al. 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common. This is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide. The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil et al. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.","There are few species-specific regulations in place to protect this species. In Queensland, Australia, there are species-specific retention limits for Grey Reef Sharks. There are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer et al. 2020). Marine Protected Areas are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil et al. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil et al. 2020).To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","This is species is retained for its meat, fins, liver and skin. Fields et al. (2018) reported that this species made up 0.31% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong. This species is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide. Skins, teeth, and liver are also used in some parts of its range."

It is a target or bycatch species in pelagic tuna longline and purse seine fisheries where it is taken in high numbers. Silky Shark is one of the three most traded shark species in the global shark fin trade. Estimates of trends in abundance over three generations (45 years) from standardized catch rate and spawning biomass indices show declines of Silky Shark in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean, Western Central Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. Across all three ocean regions, there are the major uncertainties in estimates of catch rate and population changes, and an inability to conclusively attribute any declines solely to fishing mortality as there is some potential for environmental influences on catchability and sampling artefacts. The weighted global population trend estimated a 47-54% decline over three generations. This reflects the proportionate contribution of each region’s Silky Shark population change. The estimated level of decline and the uncertainties in the data warrants a global status of Vulnerable. This assessment should be revisited when more definitive catch data and stock assessments become available.","The Silky Shark has a circumglobal distribution in tropical waters (Last and Stevens 2009). In the Western Atlantic it ranges from Massachusetts, USA, to southern Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. The species is also found from St. Paul's Rocks in the Central Atlantic. In the Eastern Atlantic it ranges from Madeira, the Atlantic coast of Spain, and from Senegal to northern Angola. In the Indian Ocean, the species occurs off Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania, Comoros and Aldabra Island, also from Somalia to the Maldives, Oman, Red Sea, and Sri Lanka. In the Western Pacific, Silky Shark occurs off Thailand, Philippines, New Caledonia, China and Taiwan (Province of China). It also occurs around the Caroline Islands, Phoenix and Line Islands westwards. In the Eastern Pacific, the species ranges from Southern Baja California to Peru. It is also present around the Hawaiian Islands, Cocos Island, Revillagigedo Islands, Clipperton and Malpelos Islands (Marín et al. 1998, Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","The Silky Shark population structure is poorly understood. Genetic studies found that in the Pacific, there are potentially three stocks; one stock in the western Pacific and two stocks in the eastern Pacific (north and south) separated by the equator (Aires da Silva et al. 2014). However, the degree of genetic separation is slight and may not be sufficient to consider them separate subpopulations. Population changes have been noted in all ocean regions but no population estimates are available. Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean Recent attempts have been made to assess the stocks from the eastern Pacific, although only indicators of population change could be used to infer changes in population due to major uncertainties in catch data from the early years of the time series (1994-1998) that hindered calculation of stock status (Aires da Silva et al. 2014, Lennert-Cody et al. 2016). For the north eastern Pacific stock, standardised catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) estimates from the purse seine fishery on floating objects indicated an overall decline from 1994-2015 that included some periods of stability, a sharp decrease from 2010-2012 followed by a sharp increase from 2012-2015 (Aires da Silva et al. 2014, Lennert-Cody et al. 2016). The cause of the changes from 2010 to 2012 and from 2012 to 2015 are unknown and may be partly due to changes in catchability, rather than abundance, because of environmental effects such as the El Niño events in 2010 and 2015 and La Niña events in 2011-2012 (Lennert-Cody et al. 2016). Additionally, in 1994 the spatial distribution of the purse seine fishery was much narrower compared to subsequent years (Aires da Silva 2014). Inclusion or exclusion of this first year of data makes a large difference to the estimate of CPUE decline over time. From 1994-2015 there was a decline of 32% (based on estimates from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody et al. 2016). To estimate this decline over three generations (45 years), the CPUE data was extracted from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody et al. 2016 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. If 1994 is included, the estimated three generation decline is 60%; if 1994 is excluded, the estimated three generation decline is 17%.For the southeast Pacific stock there was a sharp decline in standardised CPUE during 1994-2004 followed by stability up to 2013, an increase from 2013-2014 and little change in 2015 (Figure 2; Lennert-Cody et al. 2016). The estimate of decline in CPUE over the period 1994-2015 was 60% (based on Figure 2; Lennert-Cody et al. 2016). Inclusion or exclusion of the 1994 does not make a difference to the estimate of three generation decline which is 99% (based on CPUE data extracted from Figure 2; Lennert-Cody et al. 2016 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. Western Central Pacific Ocean A stock assessment for the Western Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) estimated that the 2009 fishing mortality of Silky Shark exceeded the fishing mortality producing maximum sustainable yield by over four times (Rice and Harley 2013). This level of fishing mortality is estimated to have depleted the total stock biomass by 70% from the theoretical virgin stock biomass and is indicative that overfishing has occurred (Rice and Harley 2013). Estimated spawning biomass declined by 33% from 1995-2009 (Rice and Harley 2013). The estimates of biomass declines are derived from the stock assessment model based on the standardised CPUE series which is mostly determined from WCPO observer data that has limitations of low spatial and patchy temporal coverage (Rice and Harley 2013). The estimated spawning biomass decline from the stock assessment was used to estimate a three generation change by extraction of the data from Figure 13, Rice and Harley 2013 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. A population decline of 86% over three generations was estimated. A more recent assessment of Silky Shark standardised CPUE in the WCPO extended the data series by five years from 1995 to 2014 and reported high inter-annual variability with an initial decline from 1995-2000 followed by a slight increase until 2010, followed by a steep decline (Rice et al. 2015). As the CPUE trend is different to that used in the stock assessment in Rice and Harley 2013, the more recent CPUE data was also used to estimate a three-generation change. The CPUE data was extracted from Figure 37, Rice et al. 2015 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. A population increase of 18% over three generations was estimated. The differences in CPUE data used in Rice and Harley 2013 and Rice et al. 2015 generated very different three-generation change outcomes, with the latter study emphasising the need for an updated stock assessment. At this stage, the three-generation change is taken as the mid-point of the two studies, that is a 34% decline, although this should be revisited when an updated stock assessment becomes available.In Hawaii, the Silky Shark nominal CPUE had remained stable through 2000 to 2010, indicating a possible stable population in that region (Walsh and Clarke 2011). The Hawaii data represents approximately one third of WCPO Observer data but was not included in the 2015 standardised CPUE estimates as it was only available up to 2011 (Rice et al. 2015). A study from the tropical Central Pacific comparing 1950s and 1990s longline data estimated that the Silky Shark population had declined in abundance by 92% (Ward and Myers 2005). The reduction was likely attributed to the effects of fishing, although without a time-series index it was not possible to discount contributions of variations in oceanographic conditions and biases due to the different areas and gear sampled (Ward and Myers 2005). Indian Ocean In the Indian Ocean, there is no stock assessment or any reliable fishery indicators of status, therefore the stock status is highly uncertain (IOTC 2013, Lack et al. 2014). Atlantic Ocean There is no stock assessment of the Silky Shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Analyses of longline research surveys and observer data from the Gulf of Mexico estimated that the abundance of the Silky Shark population had declined by 91% from 1950-1990 (Baum and Myers 2004). United States pelagic longline observer and logbook data (1992-2005) that encompasses both the northwest and western central Atlantic regions was used to estimate a decrease of 46 and 50% respectively in Silky Shark standardised CPUE (Cortés et al. 2007). The observer and logbook standardised CPUE data was extracted from Figures 6B and 6A respectively; Cortés et al. 2007 and the annual trend estimated using a log-linear model with gamma error. Population reductions of 95% and 98% respectively were estimated over three generations. However, Cortes et al. (2007) also reported that relative abundance of Silky Shark appeared to be increasing in the area since 2000 and advised caution in interpreting the catch trends due to short-comings in the data and the highly migratory nature of the Silky Shark that requires a more comprehensive analysis of trends throughout their range. Another analyses of the observer data from this same fishery over 1992-2005 combined catches of Dusky Shark (Carcharhinus obscurus), Silky Shark, and Night Shark (Carcharhinus signatus), grouped because of identification problems, and reported that the standardized catch rates of this species complex were suspected to have declined by 76% (Baum and Blanchard 2010).To estimate a global population trend, the three generation population trends estimated from standardized CPUE data for each region (and the spawning biomass from the WCPO) were weighted according to the relative size of each region’s surveyed area. This assumed that Silky Shark is evenly distributed throughout its surveyed range. For the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, the estimated declines in the north (60% and 17%; with and without 1994 data respectively) and the 99% decline for the south were used (based on Lennert-Cody et al. 2016 data); for the Western Central Pacific Ocean, a 34% decline was used (based on Rice and Harley 2013 and Rice et al. 2015); and in the Atlantic Ocean, as the three generation decline estimates from Cortés et al. 2007 data were so similar, the average of the two estimated declines was used, that is, 97%. The estimated weighted global population trend is a 47-54% decline over the equivalent of three generation spans. This is a best estimate based on the most reliable data currently available from each region. There are areas that have no reliable catch data, such as the Indian Ocean, which should be included in the future as data become available.",decreasing,"The Silky Shark is a circumtropical oceanic and coastal-pelagic species. It is most often found near the edge of continental and insular shelves at depths of 200 m or more in the epipelagic zone although it occurs from the surface to a depth of at least 500 m offshore (Last and Stevens 2009). It is often associated with islands, near insular slopes and over deepwater reefs preferring warmer waters (about 23°C). Smaller sharks are often found in coastal nurseries and adults further offshore over deeper water. In pelagic habitats, the Silky Shark is often associated with drifting materials on the surface (Filmalter et al. 2013). The Silky Shark generally leaves coastal nursery grounds and moves offshore to oceanic waters as sub-adults, frequently joining tuna schools on which they seem to feed (Branstetter 1987). Ontogenetic diet shifts occur from lower trophic position to higher trophic positions as the Silky Shark matures (Rabehagasoa et al. 2012). The Silky Shark gives birth to live young, averaging 5-7 pups per litter with a range of 2-18 pups per litter (Clarke et al. 2015a). Size at birth ranges from 65-81 cm total length (TL) and the gestation period ranges from 9-12 months depending on location and study (Clarke et al. 2015a). Fecundity increases with increasing size of females and females give birth every year, every two years, or sometime in between (Clarke et al. 2015a). Life history parameters vary considerably among regions (Clarke et al. 2105a). Maximum size varies from 229-371 cm TL and size at maturity from 180-230 cm TL for males and 180-246 cm TL for females. Age at maturity ranges from 5-13 years for males and 6-15 years for females with maximum ages of 8-28.6 years for males and 11-35.8 years for females. Generation length is estimated to be 15 years based on the average age of maturity of females as 9 years old and average maximum age of 21 years old (excluding outliers). This is in close agreement with generation length of 16 years in Dulvy et al. (2008). Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean Off the west coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico in the Eastern Central Pacific, maximum size was 316 cm TL and size at maturity of males and females was 180-182 cm (Hoyos-Padilla et al. 2012, Galvan-Tirado et al. 2015). Both males and females were found to mature at 7-8 years old with a maximum age of 14 and 16 years observed for the sampled males and females, respectively (Sanchez-de Ita et al. 2011). In the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico, maximum size was 229 cm TL and was smaller than the maximum size found in more open Mexican waters (Galvan-Tirado et al. 2015). Western Central Pacific Ocean Japanese tuna longline and purse seine fisheries data from across the entire Pacific Ocean indicated a maximum size of 288 cm TL. Males were mature at 180-187 cm TL and 5-6 years, and females at 193-200 cm TL and 6-7 years. Maximum age observed was 8 years for males and 13 years for females (Oshitani et al. 2003). In northeast Taiwan, maximum size was 332 cm TL. Males were mature at 213 cm TL and 9.3 years and females at 210-220 cm TL and 9.2-10.2 years. Maximum age was observed at 14 years for males and 11 years for females with a theoretical maximum age estimated as 28.6 year for males and 35.8 years for females (Joung et al. 2008). Indian Ocean In eastern Indonesia, Indian Ocean, the maximum size was 242 cm TL for males and 263 cm TL for females (Hall et al. 2012). Males were estimated to mature at 208 cm TL and at an age of 13 years (Hall et al. 2012). Females matured at 216 cm TL and 15 years of age and reached a maximum size of 263 cm TL (Hall et al. 2012). Males and females were estimated to have a maximum age of 20 and 19 years, respectively (Hall et al. 2012). Atlantic Ocean Silky Shark grow larger and mature at later sizes in the northwest Atlantic than in the Eastern Pacific and Western Central Pacific (Bonfil 2008). In the Gulf of Mexico, maximum size was recently reported as 371 cm TL (Serafy et al. 2012). In the Gulf of Mexico, males were mature at 215-225 cm TL and 6-10 years, and females at 232-246 cm and 7-12 years (Branstetter 1987, Bonfil et al. 1993, Bonfil 2008). Maximum age was estimated as at least 22 years (Bonfil 1990). In the southeast United States, females have been estimated to mature at 8 years and reach a maximum age of 27 years (Chen and Yuan 2006). Two studies from the equatorial Atlantic report differences in sizes at maturity that varied from 180-200 cm to 210-230 cm TL for males and from 230 cm to 205-210 cm TL for females (Hazin et al. 2007, Lana 2012).","The Silky Shark is the second most caught species of shark globally, after the Blue Shark (Prionace glauca) (Oliver et al. 2015). The Silky Shark is both targeted or caught as incidental (bycatch) by longline fisheries and purse seine fisheries (especially those using drifting fish aggregating devices [FADs]) as well as by artisanal fisheries. FADs are made of a floating object and nets that lie vertical in the water column to attract schools of fish. The Silky Shark, as well as other species, is easily entangled in the nets; and there have been large increases in the use of FADs since 1996 (Leroy et al. 2013). Whether they are targeted or an incidental catch, the Silky Shark is often either retained for its meat and fins where regulations allow, or released with high mortality rates apparent in the tropical purse seine fisheries (Hutchinson et al. 2015). Total catches of the Silky Shark reported to FAO are mainly from Sri Lanka (Western Indian Ocean) with the FAO catch less than 4,000 tonnes (t) from 2005-2009 before doubling in 2010 and 2011. Catches then decreased to ~5,000 t in 2012 and 2013 (FAO 2015).The Silky Shark was found to represent at least 3-4% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading centre—the third highest after Blue Shark and Hammerhead Shark (general) (Clarke et al. 2006a)—and Hong Kong is thought to make up more than half of the global shark fin trade (Clarke et al. 2004, 2006b). Silky Shark fins are valuable to the trade, although they are not one of the highest value fin types (S. Clarke, unpubl. data). Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean The Silky Shark is taken in pelagic commercial fisheries in the eastern central and southeast Pacific, as well as in coastal artisanal fisheries of the region. Fishing pressure from longline and purse seine fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish is high, and it is the main shark species caught in fisheries using FADs as well as longline fisheries in the eastern Pacific (Oliver et al. 2015). In addition to mortality, FADs may be influencing behaviour of the Silky Shark. In the eastern Pacific, Silky Shark diet contained high proportions of FAD-associated prey items, probably due to the increasing likelihood of an encounter with prey items at FADs (Duffy et al. 2015). If this behaviour continues, Silky Shark may be increasingly attracted to FADs and fishing mortality may be increased.Mexico contributed the most to catch of the Silky Shark in the north and southeast Pacific, catching up to 40% of the total catch (12-16,000 t in the north and 11-16,000 t in the south per year) (IATTC 2013). The IATTC observer database from 1993-2005 showed that the Silky Shark was caught throughout the ocean west of central America, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru out to about 170°W on purse seines set on FADs. The Silky Shark was the most commonly caught species of shark in the purse seine fishery for tunas in the eastern Pacific Ocean (IATTC 2007). The fishery has largely increased the use of FADs, which the Silky Shark is attracted to, increasing the catch rate of the Silky Shark in the fishery (Aires da Silva et al. 2014). Additionally, it is mainly juveniles caught North of the equator and caught in FAD sets.Reported catches of the Silky Shark are approximately four times higher north of the equator in the purse seine fleets (IATTC 2013). In the north, 30-45,000 individuals were caught each year (2006-2010), while in the south, &lt;10,000 individuals were caught each year (IATTC 2013). In the longline sector of the IATTC, annual catches of the Silky Shark ranged from 20-60,000 individuals in the north to 10-30,000 individuals in the south. Catches of the Silky Shark in waters around Mexico have been steadily increasing from the late 1970s, when over 3,000 t were caught to the 2000s, when 6-7,000 t of Silky Shark was caught (IATTC 2013). Central American unreported catch was estimated to be similar to the catch in Mexico of 6-7,000 sharks in recent years (IATTC 2013).The Silky Shark are a major component of the shark catch in many fisheries along the Pacific coast of Central America. Observations made on a longline research vessel that sampled waters in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala found that Silky Shark constituted 31%, 47% and 29% of the total catch respectively, and 80%, 63% and 44% of the shark catch respectively (Porras 1996). Off Chiapas, southern Mexico, Silky Shark (along with Scalloped Hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini) form the large bulk of the shark catch (Soriano-Velásquez and Acal Sánchez 2008). In Tres Marías Islands, Mexico, Silky Shark is a major part of the catch constituting 27% of landed sharks in 1996 (Pérez-Jiménez et al. 2005). In San José and Buena Vista, Guatemala, Silky Shark constituted 73% of recorded catches landed, in a sample of 4,211 sharks, from 1996 to 1999 (Ruiz and Ixquiac 2000).International longline vessels operating in the eastern central Pacific landed and exported over 8,000 t of shark carcasses and 900 t of shark fins from Costa Rica in 2002 (Costa Rica official INCOPESCA Fishery Statistics 2003), the large majority of which were recorded as the Silky Shark. However, these figures must be interpreted with caution as other sharks may have been misidentified as the Silky Shark. International vessels are known to transship shark products on the high seas, meaning these shipments are unreported. In 1991 in Costa Rica, sharks formed 27% of the total catch (Arauz et al. 2004). In 2000, only 8% of the total catch was sharks, 71% of which were Silky Shark. In 2003, the proportion of sharks in the total catch decreased further to 5% of the total catch, the Silky Shark made up 58% of the shark catch (Arauz et al. 2004). In the Costa Rican longline fishery, most of the Silky Shark catch is composed of juveniles. Since 2004, adults made up less than 15% of the Silky Shark catch (Dapp et al. 2013). Additionally, the total length of individuals caught decreased significantly from 2004 and 2007 to 2008-2010, indicating a decrease in spawning stock biomass (Dapp et al. 2013).In Manta (the largest fishing port in Ecuador), artisanal fisheries data from September 2003 to the end of 2006 showed over 22,000 Silky Shark were caught (J. Martínez pers. comm. Feb. 2007). From 2008-2012, over 137, 000 individuals were caught throughout Ecuador which is six times the amount of the previous four years (Martínez-Ortiz et al. 2015). The landed females ranged in length from 61-309 cm TL, and the males ranged in length from 63-288 cm TL. In terms of landed weight of the Silky Shark, in Ecuador in the early 2000s, less than 400 t were landed annually, and from 2007-2011, 900-1,300 t per year were landed (IATTC 2013). Catch records from 2007-2008 for nine ports in Ecuador show that catches of Silky Shark was highest in the warmer summer months from March-August (IATTC 2011). Individuals landed were mainly 114-246 cm TL for females and 101-233 cm TL for males with a peak at 160 cm TL for both sexes (IATTC 2011). This peak corresponds to immature individuals, therefore, a majority of the Silky Shark landed in Ecuador is immature. Western Central Pacific Ocean The tropical waters of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) currently support the largest industrial tuna fishery in the world with an annual tuna catch approaching one million tonnes. The two main gear types, longline and purse seine, accounted for over 90% of the target tuna catch in this area in 1999 (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species found in the longline fishery are Silky Shark, Blue Shark, Pelagic Stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea), and the Oceanic Whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus) (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species in the purse seine fishery is Silky Shark accounting for 95% of the elasmobranch bycatch in the FAD-associated purse seiners (Hutchinson et al. 2015). Due to the high rate of exploitation in the Indo-Pacific, the Silky Shark population is at risk of genetic diversity loss (Clarke et al. 2015b).In the WCPO, the longline fishery catches the highest number of Silky Shark with the estimated catch (based on observer data) in 2009 of 189,000 individuals compared to 69,790 individual Silky Shark taken in the same year for the purse seine fishery (Lawson 2011). Once brailed from purse seines, Silky Shark have been shown to be deceased 72% of the time when brought on board (Poisson et al. 2014). They have also been shown in the WCPO purse seine fishery to have a high post-release mortality of greater than 84% (Hutchinson et al. 2015). In the WCPO, longlines and purse seines mainly catch juveniles (Rice and Harley 2013). In the western Pacific, a CPUE for Silky Shark of 1-25 kg per set was found on purse seine sets on tuna schools unassociated with FADs from 1998-2010 (Leroy et al. 2013). On purse seine sets on anchored FADs, the CPUE from 1998-2010 was between 5-50 kg per set and on drifting FADs, the CPUE was 25-60 kg per set (Leroy et al. 2013).In pelagic longlines based off Hawaii, Silky Shark is caught mainly on deep sea sets. Most of the Silky Shark catch (62.5%) was taken above the equator (0° to 10°N), even though only 3% of fishing was observed above the equator (Walsh and Clarke 2011).In Taiwan, reported catches of Silky Shark increased by 1,058 t from 2003-2011 (Davidson et al. 2016). This may be due to better reporting. Malaysia does not report catches but does list Silky Shark as a commercial species that is used for fins and meat. Silky Shark is sold locally in Malaysia and prices have been increasing (Lack and Sant 2012). Similarly, Vietnam has no data available on the amount of Silky Shark caught, but it is included in catch reports of sharks (Lack and Sant 2012). In Thailand, Silky Shark is noted as being caught at a “normal” amount, however, there is little training for fisheries officers in identification. This may account for an underestimation of Silky Shark catch (Krajangdara 2014).Papua New Guinea had a coastal longline shark fishery in which Silky Shark made up &gt;50% of the shark catch (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the WCPFC requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark (see the Conservation section). Over 765 t of Silky Shark was caught in 2001. In 2011, 72% of sharks caught on longlines was Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). The proportion of Silky Shark in the shark longline catch was &gt;50% through 2013-mid 2014 (Jonathan Smart, pers. comms 2015). In the Solomon Islands, Silky Shark accounted for 23% of all longline bycatch and 84% of purse seine bycatch (in data collated in 2009; Lack and Meere 2009). The meat is kept for local subsistence and fins are exported. As of 2006, all fin exporters had to be licensed which increased the reliability of reported catches (McCoy 2006). In Fiji, Silky Shark accounted for 13% of longline bycatch and was caught in low levels in the purse seine fishery (2009 collated data; Lack and Meere 2009).The Silky Shark is a very common component of shark and tuna longline and tuna gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (Pacific and Indian Oceans) (White et al. 2006). Indonesia’s reported shark catch represents 13% of the global total shark catch. Of this, 15% were reported as Silky Shark from 2001-2004. This represents an average annual catch of 15,943 t of Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). Since 2009, a National Plan of Action-Sharks (NPOA) in Indonesia has been implemented and Silky Shark is listed as a commercial species in the Indonesian NPOA (Lack and Sant 2012). Silky Shark is fished over its entire size range with larger individuals caught on longlines at the beginning of the season and smaller individuals caught in gillnets once the catch rate on longlines decreases (Hall et al. 2012).The Silky Shark is caught by Australian longline fisheries operating on both the east and west coasts, that is, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans respectively (Australian Fisheries Management Authority 2014). Due to management restrictions, total retained catch of sharks by these fisheries is low and Silky Shark is not a major of component of those that are retained. Overall effort on the west coast of Australia is low. Due to the spatial distribution of effort on the east coast (greatest between 25-30°S), few Silky Shark are captured. No assessment of Silky Shark has been undertaken by Australia (although the east coast fishery data was included in the WCPO Silky Shark stock assessment) (Rice and Harley 2013). Australia has a range of management measures in place to mitigate impacts on all sharks. These include trip limits of a maximum of 20 sharks, a ban on the use of wire traces and shark finning bans (Gilman et al. 2007). Indian Ocean Pelagic fisheries have operated in the Indian Ocean for more than 50 years; Japanese long-liners in the eastern Indian Ocean since 1952 and in the western region since 1956. Russian, Taiwanese, and South Korean vessels have fished there since 1954-1966 (Gubanov and Paramonov 1993). Sharks are targeted in several areas, including off India where they are captured using hook and line and in large mesh gillnets, which are among the world’s largest (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Silky Shark was the most commonly caught shark at FADs in the Indian Ocean during a small pilot study of observers onboard French vessels—61.5% of Silky Shark was discarded dead at sea, 30.5% partially alive kept onboard, ~7% discarded alive (Viera and Pianet 2006). In a more recent study of FADs in the Indian Ocean, it was estimated that 480,000-960,000 Silky Shark become entangled and subsequently die annually in Indian Ocean FADs (Filmalter et al. 2013). The number of Silky Shark that die by becoming entangled in the FADs was estimated as 5-10 times higher than the number estimated to be taken as bycatch in Indian Ocean FAD-associated purse seine sets (Filmalter et al. 2013). Sharks that were caught in FADs died and fell out within two days, therefore, there is the potential for very high levels of cryptic mortality on FADs (Filmalter et al. 2013). In the Indian Ocean, due to the high abundance of FADs, it was estimated a Silky Shark has a 29% chance of surviving to age 1, 9% chance of survival to 2 years, and only a 3% chance of survival to 3 years old (Filmalter et al. 2013). On the Southwest coast of India, at Cochin, Silky Shark was recorded as a small portion of landed sharks through 2000-2002. In 2010, their contribution had increased to 16.3% of shark landings at Cochin (Kizhakudan et al. 2013); however, this increased contribution may partly be as a result of potential increase in reporting.In the Maldives, it was estimated that some 85% of oceanic shark catch comprise Silky Shark (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). Although no specific data were available, Maldivian shark fishermen who specialize in longlining for oceanic sharks anecdotally reported declines in abundance and average size of Silky Shark; all fishers commented that Silky Shark numbers had decreased by &gt;50% in the past 20 years (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). A fishery for Silky Shark has operated off Sri Lanka for many years and Sri Lanka are one of the only countries to report species-specific Silky Shark catch to FAO. The Silky Shark reported landings have decreased in Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2011 by 2,798 t (Davidson et al. 2016). Atlantic Ocean The first longline fisheries in the Atlantic were begun by the Japanese fleet in 1956 in the western equatorial waters (Uozumi and Nakano 1996). The fleet expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and covered almost the entire Atlantic by the late 1960s (Bonfil 1994), including the areas currently fished by the American fleet. Fishing pressure in the Atlantic Ocean longline fisheries is high and ongoing. In the United States, Silky Shark is caught by the commercial shark bottom longline and the pelagic longline fishery, and in recreational shark fisheries. In the shark bottom longline fishery in Gulf of Mexico and Southern Atlantic, Silky Shark represent a major by-product species (Enzenauer et al. 2015). Approximately 75% of individuals caught are retained, mainly comprising small individuals (&lt;110 cm TL). The rest are discarded, of which one third are discarded dead (Enzenauer et al. 2015). Silky Shark is one of the five most captured shark species caught in the Cuban longline fishery (Espinosa 2004).Silky Shark is taken in several longline fisheries in the Southwest Atlantic, including those off Santos, southern Brazil (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Amorim et al. 1998), Natal, northeastern Brazil (Hazin et al. 1990) and Uruguay (Marín et al. 1998). The species is taken in artisanal gillnet fisheries off southern Paraná State (Costa and Chaves 2006). In Brazil, Silky Shark is generally retained and marketed (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Marín et al. 1998). Silky Shark catch in the longline tuna fishery off Brazil increased from 2004-2008 and then declined from 2008-2010 (Fredou et al. 2015). The highest catch rates occurred near the coast, with two exceptions in the central Atlantic. Similar to most catch data of Silky Shark, a high proportion of individuals were immature (Fredou et al. 2015). In another part of the Atlantic, in Spain, the landings of Silky Shark plummeted in the early 2000s from 17 t in 2002 to ~1 t in 2011 (Eurostat 2013).","Silky Shark is a member of the family Carcharhinidae, which is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. They were listed on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under Appendix II in 2014. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by 38 countries in 2010 for migratory sharks, and Silky Shark was added to the MOU in February 2016.The Silky Shark is likely protected in the EEZs of countries that have banned all targeting of sharks in commercial fisheries operating in their waters. These countries include Palau, Mariana Islands, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Islands, the Maldives, Honduras, the Bahamas, the Marshall Islands, and the British Virgin Islands (Pew 2014). The adoption of shark finning bans by fishing states (e.g., USA, Australia, New Zealand), regional entities (EU) and all regional fisheries management organisations (e.g. ICCAT, IOTC, IATTC, WCPFC) may discourage the capture of oceanic sharks for their fins, because most finning bans require that if fins are to be retained, they must remain attached to the carcass until landed.Silky Shark retention bans are in place for all vessels operating under ICCAT and WCPFC management (ICCAT 2011, WCPFC 2016). Additionally, any Silky Shark that is brought on board must be released in the best condition possible and as quickly as possible. All interactions are recorded and the status upon release is recorded (alive or dead) (ICCAT 2011, WCPFC 2016). ICCAT has exemptions for developing countries that report the catch of Silky Shark, that have no increase in catch of Silky Shark and ensure that Silky Shark will not enter international trade (ICCAT 2011). The implementation of no retention policies for Silky Shark has likely allowed additional Silky Shark to be released, however Silky Shark have a high level of post-release mortality (&gt;84% in tropical tuna purse seines) and high level of hooking mortality (~56% on tropical longlines) (Hutchinson et al. 2015, Coelho et al. 2012). Post-release survival of Silky Shark was markedly improved in the US pelagic longline fishery in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico when circle hooks became mandatory after August 2004. Survival increased from 41% in 1992-2004 to 56% in 2004-2010 (Serafy et al. 2012). IATTC has prohibited retention of Silky Sharks on purse seine vessels, limited longline vessel Silky Shark bycatch to a maximum of 20% by weight of total catch per fishing trip, and in multi-species fisheries that use surface longlines limited the catch of Silky Sharks that are less than 100 cm total length to 20% of the total number of Silky Sharks caught per trip (IATTC 2016). No management arrangements are in place for Silky Shark in the IOTC area (Tolotti et al. 2015).Management of Silky Shark should focus on preventing capture and include small scale measures such as temporal and spatial closures as well as large scale regulations (Tolotti et al. 2015). In the Eastern Pacific, significantly more juveniles are taken above the equator, and Watson (et al. 2009) concluded that larger closures above the equator would reduce the bycatch of Silky Shark of up to 33% while having &lt;10% effect on tuna catch. Smaller closures would have smaller effects on both Silky Shark catch and tuna catch, however, would still reduce juvenile fishing mortality (Watson et al. 2009). Management of Silky Shark is made difficult by the limited knowledge of stock structure and migration patterns.<a name='_Hlk492292829'></a>","The meat of Silky Shark is used for human consumption, the fins are taken for the shark fin trade, the skin has been processed for leather and the liver has been used for liver oil (for its high vitamin A content in this species) <span lang='EN-AU'>(Vannuccini 1999)."

These species share mitochondrial DNA haplotypes but are distinguishable based on single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) (Corrigan et al. 2017) and also occupy different habitats (insular vs. continental).,"The Galapagos Shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) is a large (to at least 300 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal but patchy distribution. It is highly associated with warm temperate and tropicaloceanic islands and seamounts from the surface to depths of 285 m. The Galapagos Shark has limited biological productivity, and therefore limited ability to sustain exploitation. It is caught as bycatch in commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, both in pelagic oceanic waters and around islands and seamounts. The depletion of the Galapagos Shark has been reported at Saint Paul's Rocks, Brazil, and given the species' habitat specificity and limited biological productivity, has likely occurred elsewhere in places where fisheries are intense and unregulated, for example Madagascar. In contrast, the Galapagos Shark is suspected to be stable in a large part of its Pacific range, where it remains common in remote, protected, or lightly fished areas. Given this, and the species' wide range, the global population is not suspected to have undergone a population reduction reaching a level to suggest Near Threatened (i.e. 20–29%), and the species is assessed as Least Concern. Population monitoring is recommended where the species is fished, and enforcement of regulations in marine reserves where illegal fishing remains an issue will be important to secure local populations (e.g. Ecuador's Galápagos Marine Resources Reserve).","The Galapagos Shark has a patchy distribution mainly around warm temperate and tropical oceanic islands in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, but can also occur along the continental shelves of adjacent landmasses (Schwartz 1998, Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","Genetic data support the presence of two subpopulations: Eastern Central Pacific and Western Central Pacific/Indian Ocean (Pazmiñoet al. 2018). This study did not include samples from the Atlantic Ocean, but it is highly likely that the Atlantic would represent a third subpopulation. The Galapagos Shark is reportedly very abundant in some locations including the northwestern Hawaiian, Galápagos, and Clipperton Islands (Wetherbeeet al.1996, Last and Stevens 2009, Meyeret al. 2010). The habitat specificity of the species makes it susceptible to localized depletion, and severe population reductions have been reported from some parts of its range. It was historically considered a very common species at Saint Paul's Rocks, a group of barren islets on the mid-Atlantic Ridge (Edwards and Lubbock 1982, Luiz and Edwards 2011). Luiz and Edwards (2011) inferred that the species was locally extinct from this archipelago based on historical records and a lack of contemporary records (with the last sighting in 1993). However, there are several recent records since 2010 suggesting that the species may be returning to the area (Hazin et al.2018).  Friedlander and DeMartini (2002) showed contrasting Galapagos Shark densities between the remote and lightly fished northwestern Hawaiian islands (0.13 tonne per hectare) and the urbanized, heavily fished main Hawaiian Islands (species not observed). It is likely that population reductions have occurred where the species has been subject to fishing pressure, especially given its limited biological productivity. In contrast, the Galapagos Shark population is suspected to be stable in many parts of its Pacific range, where it remains common in remote, protected, or lightly fished areas. Unstandardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for purse seine and longline sets in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean from 1995 to 2015 was variable with no real trend (although catch rates were generally low; Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). Overall, the global population is not suspected to have undergone a population reduction reaching a level to suggest Near Threatened (i.e. 20-29%).",unknown,"The Galapagos Sharkis associated with oceanic islands and seamounts, and occurs over rugged, rocky terrain in clear water, from the surface to depths of 285 m (Wetherbee et al. 1996, Meyeret al. 2010). It also forms aggregations on reef walls of isolated coral reefs and rocky islets that rise to the surface from deep oceanic waters (Edwards and Lubbock 1982, Brum and Azevedo 1995). The Galapagos Shark may reach a maximum size of 370 cm total length (TL), although 300 cm TL appears more likely; males mature at 170–250 cm TL; females mature at 205–250 cm TL (Bass et al. 1973, Wetherbee et al. 1996, Last and Stevens 2009,Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 4–16, a possible biennial or triennial reproductive cycle, and a size at birth of 57–81 cm TL(Wetherbee et al. 1996, Ebert et al. 2013). Male age-at-maturity is estimated at 6–8 years and female age-at-maturity at 6.5–9 years, with maximum age unknown (De Crosta et al. 1984). The species has a limited intrinsic rebound potential of r = 0.048 (Smith et al. 1998).","The Galapagos Shark is caught as bycatch in commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, both in pelagic oceanic waters and around islands and seamounts (e.g. Camhi et al. 2008, Martínez-Ortiz et al. 2015, Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). Overfishing has depleted the species in some areas; this has been well documented at Saint Paul's Rocks, Brazil (Luiz and Edwards 2011), but is also likely to have occurred elsewhere in places that fisheries are intense and unregulated, for example Madagascar. Illegal fishing in marine reserves is an ongoing issue (e.g. Galápagos; Carr et al. 2013, Schiller et al. 2015).In the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Galapagos Shark, along with the Tiger Shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), are predators of the Endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal (Monachus schauinslandi) (Meyer et al. 2010), and there have been recent calls for local culls of these sharks.","A sizable part of the range of the Galapagos Shark is within marine protected area, especially in the Pacific. These include New Zealand's Kermadec Island Marine Reserve, Hawaii's PapahānaumokuākeaMarine National Monument, Australia's Lord Howe Marine Park, and Ecuador's Galápagos Marine Resources Reserve, among others. Additionally, there are recent fishing closures around Saint Paul's Rocks, Brazil, where the species had been considered locally extinct (Luiz and Edwards 2011), although there are now recent records at the site (Hazin et al. 2018). Levels of protection and enforcement vary between reserves/closed areas, and illegal fishing is an issue in some, such as the Galápagos (Carr et al. 2013, Schiller et al. 2015). The retention of Galapagos Sharks from U.S. Atlantic fisheries has been prohibited since 1999. There is a need for the collection of species-specific catch data, the monitoring of existing populations, and species-specific protection where the species has been depleted (e.g. Brazil).","There is little published information on use and trade of the Galapagos shark. The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarkeet al.2006a,Clarkeet al.2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015,Fieldset al.2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Fins enter international trade, and the meat is reported to be used in some regions where it is sold fresh locally and dried for international trade."

It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 140 m, though mostly it occurs close inshore. It also often occurs in large schools near the surface, and it has inshore nursery grounds. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The Blacktip Shark is estimated to be sustainably fished in areas where management measures are in place, i.e., the United States Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic, Australia, and South Africa. Species-specific population trend data from these regions reveal population reductions of &lt;20% over the past three generation lengths in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa (27–45 years). The North Atlantic population reduction in the spawning stock fecundity was not to a level where the stock was overfished, while in Australia, stock assessments on the Blacktip Shark complex indicate stocks have recovered from previous overfishing and are now sustainable. In the Arabian Seas region, a population decline of 30–49% is suspected for the Blacktip Shark. Elsewhere, little data is available, but the species is exposed to intensive and unmanaged fishing effort and due to its preference for inshore habitats, has limited refuge from fishing pressure. There is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range where there is a lack of management, despite ongoing high levels of effort; declines in whaler sharks across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 54% reduction in the Blacktip Shark over the average past three generation lengths (38 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Overall, it is suspected that the Blacktip Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (27–49 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Blacktip Shark has a circumglobal distribution (Yano and Morrissey 1999, Ebert et al. 2013, Hylton et al. 2017, Psomadakis et al. 2019).","Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between ocean basins (western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea distinct from eastern Atlantic and Indo-Pacific), potentially within ocean basins, and likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Keeney and Heist 2006, Sodré et al. 2012, Spaet et al. 2015, Almojil et al. 2018, Johnson et al. 2018, Bester-van der Marewe et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from three sources: stock assessments in (1) the Gulf of Mexico (SEDAR 2018) and (2) the Northwest Atlantic (SEDAR 2020); and standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in (3) the Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the stock assessment from the northern Gulf of Mexico estimated that in 2016 the stock was not overfished and that overfishing was not occurring; the stock appeared capable of supporting the current fishing pressure (SEDAR 2018). The population declined from 1981 to the early 2000s, and then began to slightly increase, possibly in response to more limited catches in the latter years (SEDAR 2018). The spawning stock fecundity was estimated to have reduced from virgin levels in 1981 by 1–32%, but most likely by &lt;5% (SEDAR 2018). The trend analysis of the northern Gulf of Mexico abundance for 1981–2016 (36 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.2%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 6.6% over three generation lengths (45 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% population reduction over three generation lengths.Second, the stock assessment from the North Atlantic (from Maine to Florida) estimated that in 2018 the stock was not overfished and that overfishing was not occurring, although it had experienced overfishing in some previous years (SEDAR 2020). Although the spawning stock fecundity declined by 54% over 38 years from 1981 to 2018, it did not fall below the minimum stock size threshold (MSST) which is used as a benchmark for stock status (SEDAR 2020). The trend analysis of the spawning stock fecundity for 1981–2018 (38 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 59.2% over three generation lengths (36 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% population reduction over three generation lengths.Thirdly, the standardized CPUE from the Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) bather protection program (South Africa) fluctuated but steadily declined from 1981 to 2019 (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 20.3% over three generation lengths (27 years), with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths. In contrast, both recreational and commercial fishermen as well as SCUBA divers have noticed a marked increase in the abundance of Blacktip Sharks off the KwaZulu-Natal coast since ~2006 (M. Dicken, KZN Sharks Board, unpubl. data 2016). Indeed, the Blacktip Shark is considered a common species off the KwaZulu-Natal coast and is one of the most commonly caught species in both the KZNSB program (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) and competitive shore angling fishery (Pradervand 2004, Pradervand et al. 2007).Additionally, standardized CPUE is available for combined Blacktip Shark and Australian Blacktip Shark (C. tilstoni) from longline fishery independent surveys in northwest Australia (Braccini et al. 2020). The CPUE for 2003–2017 fluctuated, but overall was mostly stable, although there was a high level of uncertainty as the catches were relatively low. The area of the surveys was closed to commercial fishing from 1993 to 2005 onwards and the fluctuating, but overall stable pattern is suggested to reflect either no major detrimental fishing effects on the population even prior to the closures or naturally low abundance that precludes detecting abundance patterns (Braccini et al. 2020). The lack of targeted fishing or incidental catch since ~2009 means there is no longer a threat in that region. Elsewhere in Australia, stock assessments for the Blacktip Shark species complex that consists of Blacktip Shark, Australian Blacktip Shark, and Spottail Shark (C. sorrah) suggest that while the northern Australian stock was over-exploited in the past, on the North and West Coast and on the East Coast the complex has recovered from previous fishing and is currently sustainable (Bradshaw et al. 2013, Grubert et al. 2013. Johnson et al. 2018). Two of the species in the Blacktip Shark species complex are difficult to visually distinguish which has hampered species-specific stock status determination (Johnson et al. 2018)In the Arabian Seas region, the Blacktip Shark is a common component of fishery catches (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013, Jabado et al. 2015, Spaet and Berumen 2015). In some areas, it is the most common species landed, for e.g., in the Gulf of Aden and off the Socotra Islands, Yemen (Shaher 2007). Declines have been noted in some parts of the region, for e.g., in Oman, it was one of the most commonly caught species representing up to 7% of shark landings by number in 2002, but there was a noticeable decline in landings in 2003 to 1% of shark landings by number (Henderson et al. 2007). In Pakistan, it was commonly taken in artisanal fisheries but has declined by 20–30% since 1999 (M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). In India, it was one of the most commonly caught shark species in the 1990s. However, in the last 10–15 years there has been a 60% decline in landings despite stable or increasing fishing effort (S.J. Kizhakudan pers. comm. to K.K. Akhilesh 09 February 2017) with reports that stocks of Blacktip Sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) have collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches with a population reduction of 30–49% suspected for the Blacktip Shark over the past three generation lengths (~39 years) (Jabado et al. 2017).Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Blacktip Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark, Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 54% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Blacktip Shark (38 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.Across the regions, the Blacktip Shark is estimated to be sustainably fished in areas where management measures are in place, i.e., Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic, Australia, and South Africa. Population declines of &lt;20% were estimated in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, and although there were 50–79% declines in North Atlantic, the spawning stock fecundity in 2018 did not indicate overfishing. Stock assessments in Australia suggest that while the stock was over-exploited in the past, it has recovered and is currently sustainable. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, high demand for the fins, and the presence of intensive fisheries mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population reductions. Across the Arabian Seas region, it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (~39 years). The declines across the LMEs equate to a 54% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three average generation lengths of the Blacktip Shark (38 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. Overall, it is suspected that the Blacktip Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generations lengths (27–49 years) due to levels of exploitation.",decreasing,"The Blacktip Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate seas on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 140 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It mostly occurs close inshore including off river mouths, in estuaries, shallow muddy bays, mangroves, lagoons, and coral reef drop-offs (Ebert et al. 2013). It often occurs in large schools near the surface and has inshore nursery grounds (Hueter et al. 2007, Ebert et al. 2013, Kajiura and Tellman 2016, Amojil et al. 2018). The species reaches a maximum size of 286 cm total length (TL), males mature at 125–201 cm TL and females mature at 145–207 cm TL, with regional variation in these and age parameters; maximum size and size-at-maturity is smaller in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico than in the Indo-Pacific (Branstetter 1987, Dudley and Cliff 1993, Castro 1996, Carlson et al. 2006, White 2007, Tovar-Ávila et al. 2009, Moore et al. 2012, Smart et al. 2015, Jabado et al. 2016, Harry et al. 2019). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta and litter sizes of 1–11, a biennial-triennial reproductive cycle (varies regionally), and size-at-birth of 38–72 cm (Dudley and Cliff 1993, Castro 1996, Capapé et al. 2004, White 2007, Harry et al. 2019). In Australia and Indonesia, female age-at-maturity is 8.3 and 7.6 years and maximum age is 24 and 17 years; thus, generation length is 16.2 and 12.3 years, respectively (Smart et al. 2015, Harry et al. 2019). In South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 7 years and maximum age is 11 years, resulting in a generation length of 9 years (Winter and Cliff 1996). In the Gulf of Mexico and Northwest Atlantic, female age-at-maturity is 6.5 and 6.7 years and maximum age is 23.5 and 17.5 years; thus, generation length is 15.0 and 12.1 years, respectively (Carlson et al. 2006, Passerotti and Baremore 2012, Baremore and Passerotti 2013, Deacy et al. 2018, SEDAR 2020).","The Blacktip Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is retained for its valuable meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is caught in recreational fishing and mostly released and is also caught in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, SEDAR 2020). Post-release mortality of sharks released alive was estimated at 44% and 31% for the United States commercial demersal longlines and gillnets respectively, and 19–23% for recreational line fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (Mohan et al. 2020, SEDAR 2020).In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged commercial fisheries in many areas. For e.g., in Venezuela, industrial and artisanal fisheries have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years. For e.g, effective fishing effort of the small-scale fleet operating off Mauritania is estimated to have increased by a factor of 10 during the past 25 years (Gascuel 2007). The Blacktip Shark is occasionally caught in the Mediterranean Sea driftnet fishery (Walker et al. 2005). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC 2019).","Species- specific measures are in place in two countries, the United States (US) and Australia. In the US, the Blacktip Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Management Plan. Management measures include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers (SEDAR 2020). In Australia, the Blacktip Shark is managed as a complex with the morphologically similar species, the Australian Blacktip Shark and the Spotttail Shark. Management measures limit fishing effort and catch for commercial and recreational fishers, and 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones (Bradshaw et al. 2013, Grubert et al. 2013, Johnson et al. 2018).In South Africa, this species is present in several Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), including iSimangaliso, uThukela Banks, Aliwal Shoal, Protea Banks, Trafalar and Pondoland (Dicken and Hosking 2009, M. Dicken, Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB), pers. obs. 20 January 2016). Although this species is currently not heavily exploited, MPAs may become more important should targeted fishing develop in the future. With regard to the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets, the KZNSB has reduced fishing effort in order to reduce captures of all exploited species.Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","The meat is valuable and sold at both local and international markets (Akhilesh 2011, Ebert et al. 2013). There is a preference for its meat in the United States; similar species are also sold under the name ‘Blacktip’ (Ebert et al. 2013). The fins are valuable (fins with black tips obtain higher prices) and are traded internationally; Blacktip Shark fins accounted for 0.4% of fin samples analysed in Hong Kong (Fields et al. 2018). The liver oil is used for the cosmetics and nutraceutical sectors (Ebert et al. 2013, Cardeñosa 2019), and the skin is used to produce leather."

The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries through much of its range in gears including longline, gillnet, handline and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth, and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in the habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 51.2% over three generation lengths (44 years), but this is likely an over-estimate because of complex spatial and ecological factors that affect the abundance of this species. Therefore, the Blacktip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Blacktip Reef Sharkis a common tropical Indo-West Pacific and central Pacific species occurring from Africa to Central Pacific, including most of the islands with coral reefs (Compagno 1984, Last and Stevens 2009). It is also known from reefs in the Eastern Pacific (Lopez-Garro et al. 2012). This shark has been reported form the Mediterranean Sea (Serena et al. in press), probably entering via the Suez Canal from the Red Sea, and has been recorded as far west as Tunisia (Bradai et al. 2012).","Genetic studies support the presence of multiple subpopulations throughout its range, with structure detected between and within island groups in the Pacific (Vingnaud et al. 2014). How many subpopulations exist is currently unknown because of limited sampling of most locations.The Blacktip Reef Shark in common in tropical and subtropical waters but there is little data available on population status and trends. Severe localized depletions in reef sharks, that include the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been recorded from the Indian Ocean (Graham et al. 2010). <span class='apple-converted-space'>Based on diving survey data, Grahamet al. (2010) showed that the number of reef sharks in the Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean) declined from a mean of 4.2 sharks per dive in 1970 to 0.4 in 2006, which represents a population reduction of 94% over three generations (44 years). Species-specific data were available for the period between 1996 and 2006 and showed a decline in the Blacktip Reef Shark to a level where it was rarely encountered in 2006 (Grahamet al. 2010). Towed-diver surveys performed in theWestern Central Pacificbetween 2004 and 2010showed that reef shark densities are higher at remote locations with very limited or no human presence(Nadonet al. 2012). Based on a modelling approach, they estimated that reef sharks (including the Blacktip Reef Shark) in this region<span class='apple-converted-space'>have declined to 3–10% of baseline levels, with baseline considered absence of humans (Nadonet al.<span class='apple-converted-space'> 2012)<span class='apple-converted-space'>. Approximately 6% of all the sharks recorded during towed surveys (4,620 sharks) were the Blacktip Reef Shark, which was not present at all sites.<span class='apple-converted-space'>Based on this information it is suspected that reef shark populations, including the Blacktip Reef Shark, have been reduced in the Western Central Pacific, particularly in islands such as the Hawaiian Main Island, Mariana Islands, and Samoa that have high human population densities (Chin et al. 2011, <span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'>Nadon et al.<span class='apple-converted-space'> 2012)<span class='apple-converted-space'>. Given the high level of population structuring in this species, localised studies are unlikely to provide a good indication of overall population trend. In many parts of south and east Asia (e.g. Sri Lanka, Myanmar) this is the only reef shark species that remains, following the loss of species such as the Grey Reef Shark and Whitetip Reef Shark, suggesting that population declines are not as severe as reported for these other species.<span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'><span class='apple-converted-space'>To account for differences in the trend of Blacktip Reef Shark between locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed using data from the Global Finprint project (MacNeil et al. 2020) that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range. This is the largest and most recent data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to total global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Blacktip Reef Sharks was estimated as 51.2% (standard error 43.3–59.6%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (44 years) (see Supplementary Information). The error estimates include both the IUCN Red List Vulnerable and Endangered categories. However, the ability of the Global Finprint data to estimate depletion for this species is limited by complex ecological patterns not accounted for in the methodology. As a result it over-estimates the level of decline at some reefs where population levels are thought to be healthy. As such, it is estimated that the Blacktip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (44 years).",decreasing,"The Blacktip Reef Shark is a coastal species that is common in shallow water on and near coral reefs, where it occurs from the surface to depths of at least 75 m. It is often associated with coral reefs, but in many locations the young use mangrove systems early in life if they are available (Chin et al. 2013a). It reaches a maximum size of 180 cm total length (TL) and maturity is reached between 90 and 134 cm TL (Compagno 1984, Stevens 1984, Last and Stevens 2009, Chin et al. 2013b).Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta and small litters of 2–4 pups (Compagno 1984, Lyle 1987, Last and Stevens 2009), a biennial reproductive cycle (Stevens 1984) and a size-at-birth of 30–50 cm TL (Mourieret al. 2013). On the Great Barrier Reef males mature at 4.2 years and females at 8.5 years. Longevity of field sampled individuals was estimated as 15 years, but this is known to be an underestimation due to limitations in age estimation methods, and captive animals have lived for over 25 years (Chin et al. 2013b); using these age data the generation length is estimated to be between 12–17 years (average of 14.5 years).","The Blacktip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small scale longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in continental shelf waters and those around oceanic islands and reefs, especially those around coral reefs. Most are taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. For example, in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef it makes up 1.1% of shark catch in inshore gillnets (Harry et al. 2011) and 5% of sharks caught in the line fishery for reef teleosts (Heupel et al. 2009). In Indonesia it makes up 0.3% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter et al. In press).While in Fiji, Blacktip Reef Shark makes up more than half of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus et al. 2015). The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. There is limited species-specific catch trend data available for most countries, however, throughout much of the species' range there are intensive coastal fisheries that are likely to exert significant pressure on the stocks. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and the effort continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza et al. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon et al. 2012), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.This species is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide.The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil et al. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.","There are currently no species-specific conservation or management plans in place. There are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer et al. 2020). MPAs are common in coral reef areas of many range states throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge (MacNeil et al. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire EEZs, provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil et al. 2020).On the Queensland east coast (including the Great Barrier Reef), shark catch (including the Blacktip Reef Shark) is managed through a limited entry license fishery with a maximum annual total allowable catch of 600 tonnes (whole weight, for all shark species combined). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",The flesh is used fresh and dry salted for human consumption (Last and Stevens 2009). Fields et al. (2018) reported that this species made up 0.04% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong. It may also be retained for its liver oil and skin. This species is often displayed in public aquaria and is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to facilities worldwide.

These species share mitochondrial DNA haplotypes but are distinguishable based on single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) (Corrigan et al. 2017) and also occupy different habitats (insular vs. continental).,"The Dusky Shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) is a large (to 420 cm total length) coastal and pelagic shark with a patchy distribution in tropical and warm temperate seas from the surface down to depths of 500 m. The species has low biological productivity with late age-at-maturity and a long reproductive cycle. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries and is often retained for the meat and fins. Steep declines have occurred in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern IndianOcean, and to a lesser degree, in the Western IndianOcean; trends in the Eastern Atlantic off West Africa are suspected to be declining. The global population reduction is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 71.8%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (89.4–114 years). The areas with available abundance trend data are relatively small compared to the global distribution, and abundance trends are unknown in parts of its distribution. The overall estimated population reduction is steep and management in many parts of its range is lacking, including areas of intense exploitation, likely leading to steep inferred population reduction. However, management action in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian Ocean have resulted in the stabilization and possible slow recovery in these regions Therefore, the Dusky Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Dusky Shark has a cosmopolitan but patchy distribution in tropical and warm temperate seas (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","There are no data on the global population size of the Dusky Shark. Genetic studies support two subpopulations of Dusky Shark, the Northwest Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific (Benavides et al. 2011, Gray et al. 2012, McCandless et al. 2014), although where other parts of the Atlantic fit into this structuring is unknown. No genetic structure was found within the Northwest Atlantic between the USA east coast and the Gulf of Mexico (Benavides et al. 2011, McCandless et al. 2014), or between Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa (Junge et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from three sources: (1) stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic (SEDAR 2016); (2) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Eastern Indian Ocean (Braccini and O'Malley 2018); and, (3) standardized CPUE in the Western Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker et al. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).  First, the stock assessment in the Northwest Atlantic estimated the stock is overfished and overfishing has been occurring since the mid-1980s with a prohibition on catches in 2000 that has reduced, but not ceased, the overfishing (SEDAR 2016). The trend analysis of the Northwest Atlantic relative biomass for 1960–2015 (56 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.6%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 89.9% over three generation lengths (89.4 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Second, the Eastern Indian Ocean stock in Western Australia was previously subject to overfishing, with catch levels in the 1990s likely unsustainable (Simpfendorfer 1999, McAuley et al. 2007). The stock is now considered to be recovering following measures implemented in 2006 to reduce catches of juvenile and older Dusky Sharks, and an increase in CPUE in the latter years of the time-series; a stock assessment (in preparation) indicates that the stock should recover under the current level of fishing mortality (SAFS 2018, Braccini and O'Malley 2018). The Eastern Indian Ocean data includes Bronze Whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus) prior to 2006, however it forms a minor part of the catch and does not affect the CPUE trend (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003). The trend analysis of the Eastern Indian Ocean CPUE for 1975–2015 (41 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 98.7% over three generation lengths (114 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<span lang='EN-US'> This probability of a high level of reduction is over a very long period of three generations; it has incorporated the reductions from historically higher abundances and projected an estimated trend based on those reductions for a considerable period beyond that of the time-series, and is thus indicative of historic declines rather than the stable and increasing trend since 2006. Third, the Western Indian Ocean standardized CPUE from the South Africa beach protection program was fairly stable from 1978–2003 (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend analysis of the Western Indian Ocean CPUE for 1978–2003 (26 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.9%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 60.9% over three generation lengths (114 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.   In the Eastern Atlantic, it is known from Cabo Verde, off the coast of West Africa, where it was one of the most commonly captured species on longline surveys in 1982, but by the late 2000s was infrequently caught (Stobberup 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). The Dusky Shark could also be expected to be found further along the West African coastline (Ebert et al. 2013). Given the intense coastal shark fisheries in this region there is concern that this species may have disappeared from this large part of its Eastern Atlantic distribution.   Across the regions, the Dusky Shark was estimated to be steeply declining in the Northwest Atlantic and Eastern Indian Ocean, and declining, but to a lesser degree, in the Western Indian Ocean. The Northwest Atlantic subpopulation and the Indo-Pacific subpopulation are estimated to have both undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (89.4–114 years). To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The global estimated median reduction was 75.8%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (89.4–114 years). The areas of the three regional data sets are relatively small compared to the global distribution, and abundance trends are unknown in parts of its distribution. Overall, expert judgement elicitation inferred global population reduction was 50–79% over three generations (89.4–114 years) based on slow recovery in the Eastern Indian Ocean, prohibition in the Northwest Atlantic that is reducing catches, and actual levels of exploitation that likely result in steep suspected declines where the species is subject to unmanaged fisheries. Therefore, the Dusky Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.",decreasing,"The Dusky Shark is coastal and pelagic throughout its range, where it occurs from the surf zone to well offshore, and from the surface down to depths of 500 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 420 cm total length (TL); males mature at 265–280 cm TL, females mature at 257–310 cm TL (Simpfendorfer et al. 2002, McAuley et al. 2007, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 2–18, with a long gestation of 22 months, a two or three year reproductive cycle, and size-at-birth of 70–100 cm TL (Branstetter and Burgess 1996, Romine 2004, Dudley et al. 2005, McAuley et al. 2007).<span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'> In the Northwest Atlantic, female-age-at maturity is 17.6 years and maximum age is 42 years based on bomb-radiocarbon validated ages; generation length is therefore 29.8 years (Natanson et al. 2014). Older ages were validated in Western Australia, Eastern Indian Ocean for female age-at-maturity of 27–32 years and maximum age of 40–53 years (Simpfendorfer et al. 2002, McAuley et al. 2005), indicative of a more conservative life history for the Indo-Pacific subpopulation; using the means of these age parameters, generation length is therefore 38 years.<span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'> The estimate of intrinsic rates of population increase are low in the Indo-Pacific subpopulation, estimated from Western Australian stocks at about 0.025 per year in theabsenceof fishing (McAuley et al. 2007).","The Dusky Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (McCandless et al. 2014). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Martínez-Ortiz et al. 2015). The species is often retained for the meat and fins (Clarke et al. 2006a, Clarke et al. 2006b, Fields et al. 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). The species is taken in recreational fishing and beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, McCandless et al. 2014). At-vessel mortality was estimated at 34% in the US pelagic longline fishery, 81% in the Northwest Atlantic bottom longline fishery, and 1.3% on Western Australia demersal longlines (McCandless et al. 2014, Braccini and Waltrick 2019). Post-release mortality was estimated as up to 67% in the Northwest Atlantic bottom longline fishery, though markedly reduced when individuals were retained for less than 3 hours on the line (McCandless et al. 2014).","The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking.  In 2017, the Dusky Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which reflects Parties’ commitments to work regionally toward conservation. As of 2018, the species is also covered by the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks, which is aimed at facilitating conservation.  Dusky Sharks have not been a focus of Regional Fishery Management Organizations largely because they tend to be caught more frequently in coastal fisheries rather than on the high seas. Since the 2000s, Australia and the US have implemented fishery management measures aimed specifically at reducing Dusky Shark mortality; US commercial and recreational fishers are prohibited from retaining the species. South Africa has imposed a recreational bag limit for Dusky Sharks.  To allow recovery, it is recommended that Dusky Shark retention and landings be prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered (or above). Short of that, regional and national limits on catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, improved reporting of catch and discard data, efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, and promotion of safe release protocols are urgently needed, as is full implementation of commitments agreed through international treaties.","The meat and fins of the Dusky Shark are highly valued with the meat used fresh, dried salted, frozen, or smoked. The Dusky Shark accounted for 1.4% in 1991–2001 and 0.7% in 2014, of the shark fin imported in Hong Kong (Clarke et al. 2006a, Fields et al. 2018). The liver oil and skins are also used (Last and Stevens 2009)."

It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. Species-specific population trend data reveal population reductions of &gt;50% and &gt;80% in the United States and South Africa, respectively over the past three generation lengths (60–78 years), and stock assessments in Australia indicate a reduction of 60% over the past three generation lengths (78 years). It is also suspected to have declined by 50–79% in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (60–78 years). All of these declines are attributed to fisheries exploitation. There are signs of population recovery in areas where management measures are in place, such as the United States, South Africa, and Australia. In the Southwest Atlantic and West Africa, where species-specific information is lacking, there are high levels of unmanaged fisheries exploitation, and it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has also declined in those areas. Overall, it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations lengths (60–78 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Sandbar Shark has a circumglobal distribution (De Silva et al. 2006, White et al. 2006, Last et al. 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Sutaria et al. 2015, SEAFDEC 2016, Hylton et al. 2017, White et al. 2017, Arunrugstichai et al. 2018, Kumar et al. 2018, Psomadakis et al. 2019).","Genetic data indicate likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Portnoy et al. 2010). A molecular study suggested distinct differences between the species in the Indo-Pacific and Western Atlantic, however, a wider geographic range of samples is required (Naylor et al. 2012). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (SEDAR 2017) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the stock assessment from the Atlantic, that is, the United States (US) Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and US Caribbean, estimated that the stock was overfished but not currently experiencing overfishing (SEDAR 2017). The spawning stock fecundity had most likely reduced by 66% from virgin levels (SEDAR 2017). The low biological productivity of the species and vulnerability of non-mature animals to fishing gears suggested a stock that cannot support a high level of exploitation, however, the strict limitation on catches in recent years has halted overfishing (SEDAR 2017). The stock had previously been assessed as subject to overfishing in 2006 which led to a ban on catches and a rebuilding plan (SEDAR 2017). The trend analysis of the spawning stock fecundity for 1960–2015 (56 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.2%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 74.5% over three generation lengths (60 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% population reduction over three generation lengths.Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) bather protection program (South Africa), fluctuated but steadily declined from 1981 to 2019 (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). A decline in catch rate was also observed between the periods 1966–1972 and 1978–1987 (Cliff et al. 1988). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 88.9% over three generation lengths (78 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (78 years). It is unlikely that the observed decline is due to the KZNSB alone, as catches in the KZNSB are low. Elsewhere in South Africa, this species is not targeted by any commercial or recreational fisheries. It is likely that the declines are influenced by the heavy fishing pressure in the adjacent waters of Mozambique and Tanzania. Over the past 10 years, the CPUE in the KZNSB has been stable and possibly increasing slightly which may be a reflection of the management changes in the bather protection program which has seen a reduction in effort in order to reduce captures of species.Additionally, stock assessment of the Sandbar Shark in Australia indicated that the stock in Western Australia is now recovering while the stock in east Australia is undefined due to insufficient available information to determine status (Braccini et al. 2018). In Western Australia, the stock was previously found to be over-exploited with the breeding stock abundance declining. This led to management actions such as effort limits, gear restrictions, and spatial closures. The breeding stock is currently estimated to have declined by 60% from unfished biomass and although this is close to the minimum acceptable limit of decline and indicative of a depleted stock, biomass projections under current fishing and management measures indicate continued stock rebuilding, though this may take several decades (Braccini et al. 2018, Braccini et al. 2020). Unfished biomass is considered as 70–80 years ago when commercial fishing in Western Australia commenced and thus, the 60% population decline is over the past three generation lengths of the Sandbar Shark (78 years). Further, in northwest Australia, fishery independent surveys for 2003–2017 in an area closed to commercial fishing in 1993 that was expanded in 2005, showed that catch rates increased from 2008 to 2017 suggesting the population is beginning to recover (Braccini et al. 2020).In the Mediterranean Sea, catches of the Sandbar Shark have declined significantly. The species was common along the Levantine coast until the 1980s. Historically, the species was regularly observed in fish markets of southern Sicily and was recorded in most coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea. However, recent records in those markets and areas are sporadic with no observations of pregnant females. It is still recorded occasionally in Algerian waters (F. Hemida pers. comm. 13 April 2021) and in the Gulf of Gabès, Tunisia (Capapé et al. 2019), and the Gulf of Gökova in Turkey which appear to be nursery grounds. The population is suspected to have declined by 50–79% in the Mediterranean Sea over the past three generation lengths (69 years) (Ferretti et al. 2016).In the Arabian Seas region, the Sandbar Shark is not a common component of fishery catches. In a survey of shark landings from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, it represented 2% of shark landings by number from Yemen (Bonfil 2003). It comprised less than 1% of total elasmobranch landings by number in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea and in the shark landings of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Spaet and Berumen 2015, Jabado et al. 2016). It represented 3% of sharks by number transported from Oman and traded in the UAE (Jabado et al. 2015). The Sandbar Shark was only recently confirmed from landings in India (Sutaria et al. 2015) and Sri Lanka (De Silva 2006). Fisheries in the Arabian Seas region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches with a population decline of 50–79% suspected for the Sandbar Shark over the past three generation lengths (78 years) (Jabado et al. 2017).In Taiwan, the Sandbar Shark was one of the most abundant species in the commercial shark fishery off northeast waters, where it represented 10% of the annual total shark catch in the 1990s. However, the catches have since declined due to high fishing mortality with a substantial decrease in average sizes also noted from 1991 to 2002 (Joung et al. 2004).Across the regions, the Sandbar Shark is estimated and suspected to have declined by 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (60–78 years) due to fishing pressure. There are signs of recovery in areas where management measures are in place, such as the United States, Australia, and South Africa. In the Southwest Atlantic and West Africa, where information on this species is lacking, there are high levels of unmanaged fisheries exploitation, and it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has also declined in those areas. Overall, it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generations lengths (60–78 years) due to levels of exploitation.",decreasing,"The Sandbar Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical and temperate seas on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). It occurs in shallow waters associated with bays, estuaries and harbours and offshore on oceanic banks (Ebert et al. 2013). Some stocks make extensive seasonal migrations, such as those in the Northwest Atlantic and South Africa (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of ~240 cm total length (TL), possibly to 300 cm TL, with regional variation in size-at-maturity and age parameters; males mature at 123–180 cm TL and females mature at 129–190 cm TL (McAuley et al. 2007, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta with variable litter sizes of 1–14 pups (5–12 common), a bienniel to triennial reproductive cycle (varies regionally) and size-at-birth of 40–76 cm TL (Cliff et al. 1988, Joung and Chen 1995, Hazin et al. 2007, McAuley et al. 2007, Baremore and Hale 2012, Geraghty et al. 2016). Female age-at-maturity ranges from 8 to 16 years and maximum observed age ranges from 21 to 27 years (Casey et al. 1985, Sminkey and Musick 1995, Joung et al. 2004, McAuley et al. 2006, Romine et al. 2006, Baremore and Hale 2012, Geraghty et al. 2013, Hale and Baremore 2013, Romine et al. 2013, Geraghty et al. 2016). In this assessment, age parameters are used from: (1) the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico where female age-at-maturity is 13.1 years and maximum age is 27 years resulting in a generation length of 20 years (Baremore and Hale 2012, Hale and Baremore 2013): and (2) Western Australia where female age-at-maturity is 16.2 years and maximum age is suggested as 36 years for females resulting in a generation length of 26 years (McAuley et al. 2006). The observed maximum age from Western Australia is 25 years, however based on maximum size, maximum age is estimated as 36 years which is likely more realistic based on inference from bomb radiocarbon and oxtetracycline validation (Andrews et al. 2011, Natanson et al. 2019).","The Sandbar Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. The species is an important component of target industrial shark fisheries, and is also captured as bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries. It is captured with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl and retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is also captured in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, SEDAR 2017, Roff et al. 2018). At-vessel mortality of Sandbar Sharks varies from 3–63% for trawl, and demersal and pelagic longline, with research indicating that on longlines, larger individuals have higher mortality (Ellis et al. 2017). Short term post-release mortality of 25% was found for Sandbar Sharks caught on research longlines and released alive and in good condition (Barnes et al. 2016).In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged industrial fisheries in many areas. For e.g., in Venezuela, industrial and artisanal fisheries have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Off southern Brazil, intensive fishing on pupping and nursery grounds is thought to have caused excessively high juvenile mortality (Musick et al. 2009). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years and has been linked with declines in demersal fish stocks in several areas of the region, including Senegal and Guinea, and most notably, in higher-trophic level predators, such as sharks (Gascuel 2007). The Sandbar Shark has been intensively exploited and overfished in both coastal and pelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea (Ferretti et al. 2016). In Mozambique and Tanzania, artisanal fishing pressure has increased dramatically over the past 50 years and is intense with reported declines in sharks due to this increased pressure (Jacquet et al. 2010, Benkenstein 2013, Katikiro et al. 2014).Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). In Hawaii, the Sandbar Shark is incidentally captured as a minor component (~0.1% of observed catches) of the shark bycatch in the pelagic tuna longline fishery (Walsh et al. 2009). The species’ presence in inshore and estuarine waters and its use of coastal nursery areas means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing.","Sandbar specific management measures are in place in a few countries. In the United States Atlantic waters, the Sandbar Sharks became a prohibited species in 2008 (outside of the shark research fishery) under the Atlantic Fishery Management Plan for Consolidated Highly Migratory Species. Prohibited species must be released immediately with minimum injury and without removing them from the water (SEDAR 2017). In Australia, the Sandbar Shark is under comprehensive management plans in both Western Australia and New South Wales, the main jurisdictions where it has been caught in recent years (McAuley et al. 2014). In 2006, the Western Australian Government introduced changes in commercial fisheries to reduce mortality, particularly of Sandbar Shark and Dusky Shark (Carcharhinus obscurus), including a maximum size limit, additional controls on the use of longlines, and extension of spatial closures to protect the adult component of the stocks (McAuley et al. 2005, Molony et al. 2013). In New South Wales, there is a 500 kg weekly trip limit and a 160 t total allowable catch for large shark species, including Sandbar Shark (Broadhurst et al. 2014).In Turkey, Sandbar Shark fisheries are prohibited (Ferretti et al. 2016). In South Africa, this species may be present in the Aliwal Shoal, St. Lucia, and Maputalands Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) which provide refuge from commercial, but not recreational fishing which is permitted in the MPAs. With regard to the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets, the KZNSB has reduced fishing effort in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific measures. Many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Kuwait), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets).To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","The species is used for its valuable meat and fins and to a lesser extent for its skin and liver oil (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013). The proportion of Sandbar Shark fins in the Hong Kong shark fin trade appears to have declined from 2.4% to 0.2% from 2002 to 2015 (Clarke et al. 2006, Fields et al. 2018). The species is displayed in public aquaria (Ebert et al. 2013)."

This is among the most productive of sharks with fast growth rates, early maturity, and moderate fecundity, suggesting that this species is more resilient to exploitation relative to most other shark species. It is caught as target and bycatch throughout its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is retained for its meat, fins, skin, teeth and liver oil. It is often one of the species most commonly still caught in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries throughout southern and south-east Asia, and Australia. Limited species-specific data is available on the population trend, but carcharhinid sharks throughout much of the region have declined due to the intensive level of fishing pressure. In northern Australia, the species has recovered from historic overfishing and is currently sustainably fished, providing some refuge for the species. While the Spottail Shark's high productivity allows it to sustain higher levels of fishing mortality than many other species, there are reports that its abundance has declined in areas with very intensive fishing. Therefore, the Spottail Shark is suspected to almost meet decline criteria and is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A2d.","The Spottail Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-West Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","There are few species-specific data on the population trend of the Spottail Shark. In Australia, three separate stocks are recognized (east coast, north/west coast, and Gulf of Carpentaria) (<span style=''>Ovenden et al. 2007). All stocks are currently assessed as sustainable as part of a multispecies assessment of 'blacktip' sharks (Graceful Shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchoides), Blacktip Shark (C.limbatus), Spottail Shark, and Australian Blacktip Shark (C.tilstoni)) <span style=''>(Johnson et al. 2018). Assessments of population status using tag-recapture data indicate that current catch levels are sufficient to maintain stocks at sustainable levels in the north/west and east stocks (Bradshaw et al. 2013, Harry et al. 2016). Catches by foreign vessels in the 1970s and 1980s across northern Australia are believed to have caused significant population depletion, but regulation changes that resulted in only a small domestic fleet targeting sharks since the mid-1980s has allowed the stocks to recover and they are believed to be close to pre-fishing levels.Throughout most of its Asian range, the Spottail Shark continues to be one of the most commonly landed coastal sharks, including in Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. Given the ongoing and intensive coastal fishing pressure through much of this range, it is one of the most productive species in the region. In Indonesia, this species is commonly caught, especially along the Indian Ocean coast (Blaber et al. 2009). Reconstructed catch data for the Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) shows carcharhinids increased throughout the mid to late 1900s. Although landings or catch data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In Eastern Indonesia, carcharhinid catch increased 5,640% from 1970 to the late 1980s before it rapidly decreased ~325% in the mid 1990s to 11,500 t; catch has remained relatively stable since (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Central Indonesia, catch of carcharhinids began increasing in the early 1960s before reaching a peak in 1983 and remaining stable between 15,000 and 17,500 t until 2004. After which, carcharhinid catch was between 5,600 and 14,000 t until 2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catch of carcharhinids in the Indonesian EEZ of the Indian Ocean began increasing in the 1960 and steadily increased until 1994 at ~47,500 t. Catch has since decreased to ~33,000 t per year despite continually increasing effort, which is equivalent to a 30% decline over three generation lengths (24 years) of the Spottail Shark.In Peninsular Malaysia, catches of carcharhinids in the east has increased at a relatively stable rate beginning in the 1950s to 2014 with catch of ~4,500 t. In the west, carcharhinid catch sharply increased in the early 1960s from under 1,000 t per year to ~6,500 t by the late 1970s. Catch has since decreased sharply and has been under 2,000 t per year since 2010, equivalent to a 52% decline over 3 generation lengths (24 years) (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Borneo, carcharhinid landings increased in Sarawak throughout the 1950s and sharply increased in the early 1970s to over 7,000 t. They then decreased to 4–5,000 t throughout the 1980s before increasing to 7,400 t again in 1997 and then decreasing to 2,500 t in 2014, equivalent to a 79% decline over 3 generation lengths (24 years) (Pauly et al. 2020). In Sabah, landings of carcharhinids slowly increased from the 1950s to the late 1980s before steeply increasing to 14,800 t in 1995 and then decreasing to 9,400 t in 2014, equivalent to a 44% decline over 3 generation lengths (24 years) (Pauly et al. 2020). Fishing pressure has been increasing since the 1950s and thus these declines infer reductions in the populations of carcharhinids in Borneo. These levels of decline are not species-specific but informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Viet Nam, despite the lack of species-specific data, catches of sharks and rays from 1950–2014 have been reconstructed for the Viet Nam EEZ, based on landings data (Pauly et al. 2020). The reconstructed catch data showed an 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates in the Viet Nam EEZ over 29 years from 1986–2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly et al. 2020). These declines in sharks, rays, and skates landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly et al. 2020). When this decline is scaled to three generation lengths (24 years) it represents a decline <span style=''>of 95%, in Viet Nam.<span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>There is limited species-specific landings data available from Myanmar, and the nation provided no data to FAO on landings between 1956 and 1972, making specific inference on the state of populations difficult. However, reconstructed marine fisheries landings data are available from 1950, including estimates of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (Booth and Pauly 2011). In general, fisheries catches (all species, not just sharks) increased steadily from about 200,000 t in 1950 to about 700,000 t in the late 1990s. From the late 1990s, a rapid increase in landings from offshore fishing saw an increase in annual landings to almost 1.5 million t. Estimates of shark and ray landings from 1950 to the late 1990s varied between varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t with no substantial trend. However, from the late 1990s landings increased to around 40,000 t per year. This increase in landings is assumed to reflect the increase in offshore fishing that occurred during this period. These are substantial catches (this level of catch places then in the top 20 shark fishing nations globally) for a nation with a relatively small EEZ. Despite the increase in shark and ray landings during the period since 1950 there are significant concerns for the status of many species.Trawl surveys undertaken by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen in 1978<span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>–1980 and 2013 showed a 50% decline in catch rates of elasmobranchs between surveys (Krakstad et al. 2014), with a noted shift from larger long-lived species to smaller short-lived species. Surveys of local markets from 2006<span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>–2010 (San San Khine 2010) demonstrated that landings are dominated by small short-lived species, which is typical of over-exploited elasmobranch communities (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). These same surveys also reported a 49% decline in the landings during this period, despite no reduction in fishing effort.<span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>The Spottail Shark dominates landings in many countries across the Arabian Seas region. It is the most commonly landed species in the United Arab Emirates making up 32% of shark landings by numberand 24% of sharks by number traded from Oman (Jabadoet al.2015a, <span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>Jabadoet al. 2015b). It is the second most commonly landed species in Iran, but time series from trawl surveys indicate a declining trend over 10 years (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017).The species dominates landings in Pakistan, where there has been a decline in landings since 1990, and in Oman (Hendersonet al.2007, M. Khan pers. comm. 9 February 2017). This species was commonly caught on the coast of India, but has declined considerably in the last decade (A.K. Akhilesh pers. comm. <span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>9 February 2017). In a pelagic longline survey undertaken between 2004-2010 in the Indian EEZ, this species represented 5% of sharks caught by number and 6% by weight (Varghese et al. 2015). Surveys at the Cochin Harbor indicate that this species comprised 11.1% of shark landings by number in 1986-1987 but declined to 1.4% in 2008 (Akhilesh et al. 2011).

Reports from Iran based on a comparison of results from trawl surveys in the Gulf indicate that the biomass of sharks (particularly carcharhinids) has been decreasing since the 1970s (Valinassabet al.2006).

Similarly, results from interviews with fishermen in the UAE indicate that the majority of fishers started seeing a decline in the abundance of sharks over 20 years ago, and that these declines have been significant (Jabadoet al.2015b). In Pakistan, catches of this species have decreased by ~70% over the past 20 years (M.

lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'><span lang='EN-US'>Thus while there is limited species-specific abundance information, the population appears to have declined because of the intensive ongoing nature of coastal fishing effort and its desirable meat and fins. There are no species-specific declines, but general declines for sharks, and at time specifically carcharhinid sharks, show declines between 30 and 98% through the species' range outside of Australian waters. Given that the Spottail Shark is one of the most productive shark species, these declines over-estimate the population reduction level of this species, but are indicative of declines nonetheless. The limited catches and healthy populations across northern Australia provide a refuge for the Spottail Shark. With fishing pressure across most of its range stable or increasing, and catches likely declining, it is suspected that the reduction in this species may be close to 30% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) and is assessed as Near Threatened, being close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A2d.",decreasing,"The Spottail Shark occurs on mud and sand substrates and coral reefs on continental and insular shelves to a depth of at least 140 m (Ebert et al. 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 196 cm total length (TL) in the Arabian Seas region, and 160 cm TL elsewhere (Ebert et al. 2013, Jabadoet al.2016). Size-at-maturity varies regionally with males mature at 106–109 cm TL in Arabian Seas and at 90 cm TL in Australia and females mature at 110–118 cm TL in Arabian Seas and 95 cm TL in Australia (Ebert et al. 2013, Jabadoet al.2016). Reproduction is viviparous with a yolk-sac placenta with litter sizes of 2–4 pups, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 44–72 cm TL (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013). Age data from Australia indicates that age-at-maturity is 2–3 years and maximum age is 14 years, resulting in a generation length of 8 years (Davenport and Stevens 1988).","There is little information on catches of the Spottail Shark as species-specific data is not usually recorded. Carcharhinids are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries throughout most of its distribution have experienced increased demand for sharks and simultaneously there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in many of these nations (e.g., Spaet and Berumen 2015). In Australia, the Spottail Shark is taken in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia (Johnson et al. 2018). The levels of catch in these fisheries is currently modest and maintained at sustainable levels.The Spottail Shark is reported to constitute 0.7% of the catch of sharks and rays at Muncar in eastern Java, Indonesia (Winter et al. 2020). Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili et al. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh et al. 2017) and worth an estimated USD 125 million USD in export (Booth et al. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White et al. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth et al. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Fahmi and Sumadhiharga 2007, Fahmi et al. 2013, Nawawi et al. 2020, Winter et al. 2020, ).Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Spottail Sharks are taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries using multiple fishing gears including trawl, seine net, longline, gillnet, and set net. All bycatch in Malaysia is retained for the meat for human consumption, for bait in traps or for fish meal production for aquaculture. Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly et al. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly et al. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak has more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly et al. 2020). There has been, and is still, currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler et al. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated to the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh et al. 2009). Reporting to FAO for sharks and rays comprises ~3% of global catch at 23,808 t per year through 2000–2010. Purse seine and gillnets contribute to the majority of the landings. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. Spottail Sharks is subject to intense fishing pressure on its coastal habitats in Viet Nam being taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, and longline, and it is retained for human consumption or for fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is some targeting of sharks using longlines, hook and line, and ‘shark lines’. Target shark fisheries developed in the 1980s in response to demand for shark fin and other products including shark skin, cartilage, and liver oil and reached a peak at the end of the 1980s followed by a decline in catches (Lack and Sant 2012, V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh et al. 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh et al. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh et al. 2014, Pauly et al. 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam’s EEZ in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly et al. 2020). The fleet tends to operate in offshore fisheries (&gt;5 nm from shore) and mostly use trawls, but also purse seine, longlines, and traps (FAO 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly et al. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh et al. 2014, FAO 2020). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly et al. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly et al. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick et al. 2017).Sharks are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard et al. 2015, Mizrahi et al. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.In Kuwait, in 2008, the Spottail Shark made up 12% of elasmobranch landings by number while in Qatar it represented 4% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore et al. 2012). In Bahrain, it represented 7% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore and Peirce 2013). In a survey of landing sites along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts, this species was reported from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt and accounted for 7% of shark landings by number (Bonfil 2003). In Yemen, it was one of the dominant species landed around Socotra Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (up to 12% of shark landings by number) (Shaher 2007). In Sudan, it made up 19% of the shark landings by number in 2002 and 11% in 2013–2014 (I. Elhassan unpubl. data 2017). It is also commonly caught by illegal Yemeni fishers operating in Sudanese waters (16% of landings by number during three days of fishing). In the Saudi Red Sea, it makes up 33% of elasmobranch landings by number, with many of those landed being juveniles targeted in nursery areas (Spaet and Berumen 2015). This species is not very common in the Maldives, although it was caught on handlines prior to the ban on shark fisheries (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Ali 2015). In Sri Lanka, it is also one of the dominant species in landings (IOTC 2014).In the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner et al. 2011). The high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in Eritrea catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye et al. 2007). While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licenses issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting shark populations (Glaser et al. 2015). In India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen et al. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating.","Very few specific conservation measures are in place for the Spottail Shark over much of its range except Australia. All Australian fisheries that target the Spottail Shark are managed. Catch is controlled by input (restrictions on entry to the fishery, effort, gear, and area that can be fished) and output (Total Allowable Catch (Queensland) or Individual Transferable Quotas (Northern Territory)) controls. Management measures maintain catches below levels that will maintain stocks at sustainable levels (Simpfendorfer and Dulvy 2017). Recreational catches of shark are restricted by bag limits, possession limits, and gear restrictions (Johnson et al. 2018). Due to its importance as a commercial target species, in Australian waters the Spottail Shark has been relatively well studied and as a result its biology and response to fishing pressure is well understood. The effect of Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing in Australian waters remains uncertain, but it is suspected that levels have decreased since a peak in the mid-2000s in response to increased border patrols, along with other factors such as the increase in fuel prices and decrease in shark fin prices (Marshall 2011).There are no other species-specific conservation measures in place in the remainder of its range. However, a number of nations have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in non-target fisheries. Some countries also have bans on specific fishing gears that benefit this species (e.g. United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters). However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnetting) to which they are more susceptible. India and UAE banned all shark fin export in 2015. Shark finning has also been banned in the UAE, Oman, Iran, India, and Sri Lanka yet trade surveys indicate that some trade in the fins and meat of this species still occurs. Spottail Sharks likely also benefit from the numerous Marine Protected Areas that occur throughout its range. However, no data are available to estimate the benefits they provide, or whether they have reduced population declines. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.","This species is retained for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin. Fields et al. (2018) reported that this species made up 1.04% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong making it one of the most common coastal species encountered in these markets."

It has been recorded from the continental slope at depths of 128–3,675 m, and mostly at depths &gt;400 m. The species was caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and industrial fisheries in some locations using a variety of fishing gear.There has been a number of management measures implemented in recent years for deep-water sharks, and the species has refuge at depth. Still, there is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range. Population declines have been reported in part of its range but increasing trends in others.The Portuguese Dogfishis estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%over the past three generations (111 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Portuguese Dogfish has a widespread, yet patchy, global distribution in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans (Ebertet al.2013).","Population genetics indicate low genetic variability and migration of individuals between the east Atlantic and Pacific populations, but have indicated there is a separate population in the Mediterranean (Catarino et al. 2015). Species-specific population trend data are available from two sources: (1) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic from Marine Scotland Science (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019) and (2) relative abundance from Canadian trawl surveys in the Northwest Atlantic (D. Kulka unpubl. data 2019).Thetime series data were analyzed over three generation lengths (111 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). First, nominal CPUE from Scottish trawl surveys suggestno trend in CPUE between 1998–2012, but increasing CPUE from 2013 to 2019 (F. Neat unpubl. data 2019).The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 10.2% consistent with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the three generation lengths.In addition, commercial landings of deep-water dogfishes in Europe (EU) and non-EU waters peaked at ~11,000 t in 2003, before rapidly declining to 220 t by 2010 in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES 2015). Secondly,the trend analysis of relativeabundance in the Northwest Atlantic between 1992–2013 (D. Kulka unpubl. data 2019)revealed an annual rate of decrease of2.7%, consistent with an estimated decrease of95.1% over three generation lengths (111 years), with the highest probability (61%) of≥80% reductions in population over three generation lengths. These results are likely to be an artefact of sampling rather than trends in true abundance; most captures of the species occur at depths &gt;900 m (Hallidayet al.2012) and sampling in this region occurs at depths between20–1500 m (D. Kulka unpubl. data 2019). In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Portuguese Dogfish, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernándezet al.2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations. Importantly, causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernándezet al.2005).Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuelet al.2007). Across the regions, the Portuguese Dogfishwas suspected to be declining across West Africa and increasing in recent years in the Northeast Atlantic.<span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='FR'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'><span lang='EN-CA'>To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region.

However, trends are unavailable for &gt;50% of its known range. Overall, a population reduction of 20–29% was estimated over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation. Therefore, the species is assessed as Near Threatened(close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).",decreasing,"The Portuguese Dogfish is demersal on the continental slope at depths of 128–3,675 m, with most records at depths &gt;400 m (Ebert et al. 2013) and peak abundance occurring at depths &gt; 1,000 m (Neat et al. 2015). It reaches a maximum size of 137 cm total length (TL); males mature at ~85–100 cm TL and females mature at 95–110 cm TL (Ebertet al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–29 pups, mostly 12–14,and size-at-birth is 25–35 cm TL (Ebert et al. 2013).Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from a related species, the Longnose Velvet Dogfish (Centroselachus crepidater) that has a female age-at-maturity of 20 years and a maximum age of 54 years, resulting in a generation length of 37 years (Irvine et al. 2006).","ThePortuguese Dogfishhas been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. The species will have refuge at depth; most records of the species are at depths &gt;900 m (e.g. Kulka 2006, Chazeau et al. 2019) and its peak distribution in the Northeast Atlantic was between 1,200–1,500 m (Neat et al. 2015). There is little to no known fishing effort in the Northwest Atlantic and Mediterranean that reaches these depths. This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of the Portuguese Dogfishwere historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Leafscale Gulper Shark,Centrophorus squamosus)in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018).Since the introduction of TAC of zero in 2010, it is likely that discarding and misreporting of the species has increased (ICES-WGEF 2018).In 2014, 50% of sampled specimens collected from longliners and landed as the Tope Shark,Galeorhinus galeus, were found to be Leafscale Gulper Shark or Portuguese Dogfish (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Mouraet al.2018).Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region.Deep-water sharks, which may include the Portuguese Dogfish, were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (Merluccius senegalensis and M. polli) fisheries (Fernándezet al.2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernándezet al.2005). Somniosid sharks (Centroscymnus spp) are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal offshore trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silvaet al.2015).In Suruga Bay, Japan, historic exploitation peaked during World War II when the species was utilized for its liver oil (Stevens and Correia 2003). In recent years, the species is infrequently reported from the region (S. Tanaka, unpubl. data 2019) and this may be attributed to refuge at depth. ThePortuguese Dogfish has been reported in the region from depths &gt;750 m (Yano and Tanaka 1987), and current fishing operations, includingadeep-water dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (Beryx splendens), which operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Pattersonet al.2018). A<a>semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019). </a>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgesonet al.2019). Of the ~1,800 t of deep-water shark catches reported in the Southern Indian Ocean in 2016, ~1,300 t was the Portuguese Dogfish (Georgesonet al.2019). The species is also occasionally reported from demersal longline fisheries operating on the Kerguelen Plateau (Chazeau et al. 2019).","Further information is required on population size and trends of the Portuguese Shark, as well as interactions with fisheries across its range, particularly around Africa. There are some species-specific and general management arrangements of relevance in place in the Northeast Atlantic and the Southwest Pacific.Elsewhere, targeted deep-water shark fishing is not permitted in the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) Convention Area or under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) (SIOFA 2019, SEAFO 2016). The species is considered a 'key species of concern' within the SIOFA area (SIOFA 2019). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range.Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Portuguese Dogfish, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish(Aphanopusspp).Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (Merluccius merluccius) and Monkfish (Lophiusspp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005. In Australia, deep-water sharks, including the Portuguese Dogfish, are assessed and managed as a multi-species stock, divided into eastern and western zone fisheries(Pattersonet al.2018). These fisheries are subject to Total Allowable Catches (TACs). A combination of trawling closures in most of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) waters deeper than 700 m since 2005, as well as the closure of the South Tasman Rise Fishery in 2007 (Pattersonet al.2018), may indirectly offer this species some refuge in this region.",The species has been utilised for its flesh and liver oil.

Estimates of abundance are variable by location, and range from 0.6 - 14.7 fish per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>(see attached table). It tends to have greater abundance in the Pacific than in the Indian Ocean. In Saudi Arabia, fisheries landings of this species ranged from 11 to 72 metric tonnes from 2000 to 2004 (www.fao.org). In the Maldives, there has been a slight reduction in average size since exploitation began (Sattar and Adams 2005). Despite heavy fishing pressure in areas such as Samoa, this species' populations appear stable, with only one locality showing declines presumably due to fishing.

It is mostly a relatively minor component of fisheries, but fishing pressure has recently increased significantly in several parts of southeast Asia (e.g., Hong Kong and Indonesia) due to severe declines in other larger-bodied grouper species. Considering there are no reported declines as of yet, the species is listed as Least Concern. Improved population and fishery monitoring in areas of heavy exploitation are highly recommended.","This Indo-West Pacific species is distributed from East Africa (Kenya to southern Mozambique), to southern India and the western Pacific, including the Ryukyu Islands (Japan), Taiwan, China and south to New Caledonia and northern Australia (Heemstra and Randall 1993).

It is abundant in Taiwan (K.T. Shao unpublished data). During 187 UVC surveys conducted in coral and rocky reef areas in Hong Kong during 2014 to 2016 it was the most frequently observed grouper (Shea and Ho 2016). According to a 1997 survey by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong, this species comprised15.5 and 25.4% by weight of catches by hand-line and cage trap (Cooket al.1997).Chan (2000) describedthis speciesas the last remaining commercially important grouper in Hong Kong. According to Liu and Sadovy (2001) it was previously not considered of much commercial importance in Hong Kong. Despite its relatively small size as compared to other grouper species, it is now being heavily fished presumably due to known declines in the large-bodied groupers; half of all specimens sampled from local municipal markets within the last few years were small (11.2 and 14.3 cm standard length) and young (aged two to four years). There are no official species-specific landings for this species in Hong Kong (Chan and Sadovy 2002).Cephalopholis boenakwas the most abundant species found during a market survey for wild-caught groupers during 2004-2006 in Hong Kong (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009).FAO landings for 'chocolate hind' is reported only by Indonesia, where landings have been steadily increasing since 1950, and especially accelerated after 2004, with the largest amount to date reported in 2015 at 58,150 tons<span style=''>(see attached file).

Among other similar-sized Cephalopholis species, this species has the smallest size of female maturation, sex change (diandric) and a fast growth rate (Chan and Sadovy 2002). It also exhibits plasticity of sexual development in juveniles which can be mediated by social conditions, as well as male to female sex change (Liu and Sadovy 2004a, b). Such characteristics may allowC. boenakto be more resilient to fisheries impacts than the typical grouper which requires longer to mature or that exhibit monandry.

It is a protogynous hermaphrodite, growth rates tend to vary depending on the region, the onset of sexual maturity is relatively late and it has a long spawning season of 7 months (Mosse 1997, Mosse and Davies 2007). There is no evidence that this species forms large spawning aggregations, and localized haremic spawning may be the norm.","Although this species is taken in local fisheries in parts of its range, loss of complex reef structure due to coral mortality is likely to be the more significant threat to its populationin the future. Declines in coral cover within its range are associated with destructive fishing practices, sediment run-off, cyclones, coral bleaching and Acanthaster outbreaks (De’ath et al. 2012). A study conducted at the Apo Island no-take marine reserve in the Philippines attributed an 82% decline in abundance of this species from 2010-2013 to a concurrent 96% decline in live coral cover (Russ and Cherh<span style=''>2017). In contrast, a study conducted at Sumilon Reserve, which is 41 km from Apo, also found declines, but was likely due to overfishing. The conclusions of these studies demonstrate that fishing can have a highly significant effect on abundance that ismediated by environmental disturbance.","There are no species-specific conservation measures.

Despite its frequent occurrence in fisheries, catch data are limited. A substantial proportion of the catch is comprised of immature individuals in certain areas. Indian Ocean: This is one of the three most common grouper species caught off northern Somalia (Darar 1994), but underwater surveys conducted on shallow, rocky reefs in northeastern Somalia recorded few individuals of this species (Mann and Fielding 2000) possibly due to its deeper depth preference. It was the third most common grouper (16% of groupers) caught on the North Kenya Banks in the late 1950s (Morgans 1964), but became less common in linefish catches in this region by the mid-1970s (Nzioka 1977). In the mid-1990s in southern Mozambique, this species was very commonly captured and comprised roughly 60% of the grouper catch in the commercial linefishery, and thereafter until at least 2005, it contributed between 7 and 25% by number(Dengo and David 1993, van der Elst et al. 1994, S. Fennessy unpublished data, D. Gove pers. comm.). Declines had likely occurred by 2002 in southern reefs of Mozambique, as the Mozambican linefishery had shifted effort to fishing grounds further to the north by 2000 (Torreset al.2003). Shallow underwater surveys (n=&gt;130) conducted in southern Mozambique did not record this species (Robertsonet al.1996, Pereira 2003), and only one was recorded in shallow surveys conducted between 1987 and 1992 in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Chateret al.1995),again possibly due to the lack of sampling effort in the deeper portion of its range.It is also commonly taken in the commercial linefishery of Madagascar (A. Pages pers. comm.).It is occasionally recorded in trap catches in central Mozambique (Abdula et al. 2000) and in boat catches from reefs off the central KwaZulu-Natal South African coast (Oceanographic Research Institute 1988, S. Fennessy unpublished data 2002-2006). It has been reported in mixed-species catches from Reunion (D. Miossec pers. comm.). Underwater surveys conducted in western India recorded this species at two of the nine shallow sites, and at a low relative abundance compared to other groupers (Sluka and Lazarus unpublished data). Pacific Ocean: Underwater surveys conducted in Australia and Indonesia indicate this species may be rather rare, but survey effort was deficient in the deeper parts of its depth range (Craig et al. 2011, Reef Life Survey 2014, COREMAP program). This species is caught incidentally in Pohnpei fisheries (Rhodes and Tupper 2007), constitutes 3% of the grouper catch in New Caledonia (M. Kulbicki pers. comm.) and is taken at some level in Guam (H. Choat pers. comm.). This is the species with the tenthhighest total catch in America Samoa, and despite relatively high fishing pressure, studies concluded that there has been little variation in its population (Luck and Dalzell 2010). In 2005, this species comprised less than 1% of grouper landings at the Yaeyama Island market (Ishigaki and Iriomote Island) of southern Okinawa, Japan (mostly caught by hook and line and spear). Landings of this species in the Philippines from 1999-2016 (past 17 years) were relatively low until an unusually large amount was captured from 2013 through 2016 (Santoset al.2017).",stable,"This species inhabits deep lagoonal coral reefs and steep outer reef slopes most commonly between 20 to 150 metres depth. It can also occur in coastal rocky substrates.

It relatively sedentary and is mostly observed near coral heads (Kaunda-Arara and Rose 2004). It primarily consumessmall fish and crustaceans (Morgans 1964, Harmelin-Vivien and Bouchon 1976).The maximum total length is 57 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Females mature at about 28 cm standard length and males at about 34 cm (Shakeel and Ahmed 1996). A likely spawning aggregation has been identified at Waigeo in Eastern Indonesia (Sadovy and Liu 2004). Similar to Cephalopholis boenak, it is possible that this species is also a protogynous hermaphrodite(Smith 1965, Liu and Sadovy 2004).","Coral reef degradation caused by destructive fishing practices, sediment run-off and bleaching events may impact this species. Fishing pressure could cause population declines for this species in some areas, especially considering its market value has increased, and so has fishing pressure in certain areas (e.g., Martosubroto 2005, Cunningham and Bodiguel 2006, Morgan 2006, Flewwelling and Hosch 2006).There are no known major threats impacting the species on a global-level at this time.","In Queensland, Australia, there is a maximum catch size for this species (Fisheries Amendment Regulation No. 2 2003).In South Africa, a maximum of 5 individuals of this species may be retained by recreational fishers per day, but there are no limits for commercial fishers. In Mozambique, a maximum of 10 individuals of demersal species may be retained by recreational fishers. A small portion of reefs are within no-take areas in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique (Wellset al.2007), but the level of compliance is not known. Much of the KwaZulu-Natal coast in South Africa is protected by a strictly enforced 145 km long marine protected area (MPA) in which no demersal fishing is allowed. An adjacent and similar MPA is under establishment in southern Mozambique (Ponta d’Ouro to Maputo), which may offer further protection for this species. Improved monitoring of exploited populations and increased survey effort in the deeper habitats occupied by this species are highly recommended.","This species is taken by mostly small-scale fisheries in parts of its range and sold in both fresh and live fish markets and in domestic and international trade. Its popularity in the live reef food fish trade has been increasing, especially due to its desirable red coloration. It was 6th amongst about 50 groupers in 2012-2013 and 3rd in 2017 in the Hong Kong retail sector, which is the global centre of this trade (Lam 2013, F. Chan unpublished data 2017, Y. Sadovy pers. obs.).Given the increased interest in chilled/frozen/fresh fish in Asia and the higher prices being obtained, increasing catch in the Philippines might be indicative of heightened interest in this species for export (Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. 2017). In the Maldives, this is one of the relatively few grouper species taken in the fishery for export live and chilled (Sattar et al. 2011). It is targeted in Indonesia for local consumption, and catch is apparentlyfrom spawning aggregations (Sadovy and Liu 2004)."

In Hong Kong, abundance variable but exists in reasonable numbers in some shallow coral areas and less abundant in areas of boulders (Sadovy and Cornish 2000).One to 25 individuals of C. chlorourus have been observed during visual surveys in 1998 and 2000 at Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia (Hutchins 2004).2.306 +/- 0.156 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup> of C. chlorourus which accounting 9.8 % of the total percentage of the density of all piscivores of the western side of Lizard Island (14°40’S, 145°28’E) have been noted in Stewart and Jones (2001).Fourty-one individuals were observed in the lagoon areas in Rodrigues, Mauritius (Hardman et al., 2008) and C. chlorourus is listed as common fish species in Taiaro Atoll (Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia) (Galzin et al. 1998).In Fiji, a total of 1,286 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 50-300 mm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008).In New Caledonia, a total of 3,644 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 30-400 mm TL. In 29 stations, a total of 68 individuals were caught with total body weight of 2,203 g (M.

Caudal fin of adult males have upper and lower rays prolonged as filaments, conversely, fin rounded in females (Sadovy and Cornish 2000).Juveniles of this species are protected by living in live branching corals, such as ,i&gt;Labrichthys unilineatus and so might explain the generally low mortality (Eckert 1987). At One Tree Lagoon, the Great Barrier Reef, overall mortality during first year for C. chlorourus was 25%, average annual mortality was 20.5 +/- 4.1 % (Eckert 1987).It feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates including molluscs, crustaceans, polychaetes and sea urchin (Froese and Pauly 2008).Maximum size of the species is 45 cm TL (Lieske and Myers 1994).","There are no major threats known for this species. However, it is caught incidentally in the live reef fish food trade in some parts of its range, and is also collected for the aquarium trade.","There are no species-specific conservation measures for this species. However, this species distribution includes a number of Marine Protected Areas within its range.In New Caledonia, individuals were found in permanent marine reserves of Southwest lagoon of New Caledonia (Wantiez et al. 1997). Cheilinus chlorourus was observed in the Tung Ping Chau Marine Park and Cape d’ Aguilar Marine Reserve, Hong Kong (Cornish 2000).In Western Australia, several small no-take zones, Surf Point, Mary Anne Island, and Sandy Point are likely to encompass habitat occupied by C. chlorourus. There are totally eight no-take zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park, spear-fishing is prohibited throughout the marine park and proposals are currently being considered for new marine parks in the Dampier Archipelago (Penn 2002) where C. chlorourus was observed (Hutchins 2004). It is worth noting that marine parks in western Australia do not necessarily imply no-take zones, but may include no-take zones within their boundaries or restrictions on catch limits or methods used for fishing. In Queensland, there is a minimum legal catch size for wrasses of 25 cm and daily catch limit of five fish per angler (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2003). In the south coast region of Western Australia, there is no minimum legal catch size for wrasse (Labridae), however the daily bag limit for the wrasse is eight fish per angler (Government of Western Australia 2008) and spear-fishing for wrasse (Labridae) is restricted in all marine park waters (Government of Western Australia 2000).","This species is collected for the marine aquarium trade.

The true fasciatus does not occur in the Red Sea. Populations of C. fasciatus recorded from the Gulf of Aden, Socotoa and NE Somalia are probably quinquecinctus, but this needs to be researched.","This species is common in many parts of its range.It is one of the most commonly observed target-species in the Louisiade Archipelago, Papua New Guinea. The percentage occurrence of C. fasciatus was 88% in the underwater census surveys of fifty-seven sites at the Louisiade Archipelago (Allen et al. 2000).It is particularly common in areas of mixed coral and rubble of lagoon patch reefs in Micronesia (Myers 1991) and is also common reef fish in the Red Sea (Richard and Field 1998). In addition, it is common on lagoon and seaward reefs at Marshall Islands (Colin and Bell 1991).Nakamura and Sano (2004) estimated the mean density of C. fasciatus in the Iriomote Island, Japan was 10 individuals per 500 m<sup>2</sup>.In the Island of Zanzibar, east Africa, mean density of C. fasciatus was found to be 7.2 individuals per 500 m<sup>2</sup> and the highest density of this species was found at Morogo with 24.5 fish per 500 m<sup>2</sup> (Dorenbosch et al. 2006). Despite the wide geographic range of this species, there is little quantitative information available on the local population status of this species. Further, the total numbers of C. fasciatus are not known.In Fiji, a total of 230 individuals were counted in various UVC surveys with body length of 6-40 cm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008).In Tonga, a total of 153 individuals were counted in various UVC surveys with body length of 6-35 cm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008).On the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, an estimated mean density of 2.6 individuals from twenty 50 m X 5 m transects was recorded in underwater fish visual surveys (Yusuf et al. 2002).",unknown,"This species is found in the coastal (Kuiter 2002, 2006), lagoon, seaward reefs, and usually in areas with mixed coral, sand and rubble (Lieske and Myers 1994, Allen 2000) at depths of four to at least 40 m (Myers 1991).Juveniles of this species are often associated with the sea-grass beds and mangroves that adjacent to coral reefs (Dorenbosch et al. 2006), along edges with algae-rubble and sand, and silty reefs (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). Small juveniles are mistaken as adult of Wetmorella spp. or mis-identified as Epibulus spp. Due to their thin vertical white barring (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001, Kuiter 2002). The jaw is prominent, especially lower jaw in adults, two strong canines situated anteriorly in each jaw and there is no enlarged tooth present on rear or upper jaw of this species. Caudal fin rounded in juveniles, while the upper and lower rays forming extended cadual fin lobes in large individuals, a trilobed appearance. The lateral line of this species is interrupted below the posterior portion of dorsal-fin base with a total of 22 or 23 pored scales (Westneat 2001). It is distinguished by the bright red area at front of body (Allen 2000, Kuiter 2002) and thin orange to red lines radiating from eyes (Kuiter 2006). In large individuals, the six dark bars are usually broader than the six light ones (Westneat 2001).It feeds primarily upon benthic small hard-shelled invertebrates, such as molluscs, crustaceans and sea urchin (Myers 1991, Westneat 2001) by possessing a strong oral jaw (Sale 2002).In Marshall Islands, spawning was observed on the winward lagoon. It was found that spawning was not influenced by tidal currents. It spawned in harem with males patrolling territory. Patrolling males swam with the caudal fin folded and the dorsal and anal fin tips folded to points. Spawning activities lasted for almost three hours and concurred with similar activity by male Epibulus insidiator. Females ascended about one to three m over patch reef or coral head when ready to spawn with slow ascending speed (two to four sec. to go up with a length of 1.5 m). Spawning was observed only during afternoon and occurred at different tidal phases. Spawning activities were observed in May and October, while courtship was found in June and November (Colin and Bell 1991). Further, the mean planktonic larval duration of this species was found to be 25.7 +/- 1.4 days (Victor 1986). The maximum size is approximately 40 cm SL (Westneat 2001).","There are no major threats known for this species. This species is caught for food and for the aquarium trade in some parts of its range.Labrids are frequently captured by recreational and commercial fishers in Australia which are known to contribute to significant reductions in labrid densities (Gladstone 2001, Platten et al. 2002). Majority of the Cheilinus spp. captured by recreational fishers are reported as “wrasse/grouper” making the catch statistics under-representative of the real landings of C. fasciatus. In Gascoyne region, a 12 month survey indicated that 9,677 wrasse/groupers are captured by recreational fishers annually and in Shark Bay, western Australia, 10,082 individuals from wrasse/gropers were fishes annually (Summer et al. 2002). Meanwhile, on the west coast of western Australia, it was found that 65,000 individuals of various species from wrasse/groper were caught in recreational fishing (Summer and Williamson 1999).","There are no species-specific conservation measures for this species. However, this species distribution includes a number of Marine Protected Areas within its range.

The minimum legal size for Labridae is 40 cm and the daily catch for Labridae is two per individuals per species per fisher, while the mixed daily bag limit is seven individuals per angler. Currently, management plans are being developed for the new Marine Conservation Parks which including no-take zones (Government of Western Australia 2008).In Gascoyne region of Australia, there is no legal catch size for the Labridae and daily catch limit is seven individuals per angler. No spearfishing is allowed within the Ningaloo Marine Park (Government of Western Australia 2008a).","This species is noted as both food fish and ornamental fish in Taiwan (Shao 2008). Globally, it is marketed in small numbers and occasionally seen in the aquarium trade (Westneat 2001). In Queensland, it is marketed at prices ranging from AUD USD  6 to USD  15, depending upon the size of this species (Ryan and Clarke 2005). While in Papua New Guinea it is collected by line fishing by local fishers (Johannes and MacFarlane 1991, Allen et al. 2000).The average body size caught in Guam over the past 20 years has been relatively constant and averages 25 cm (R.

Marine parks are zoned for different purposes including no-take core zone and no fishing is allowed within the marine reserve unless authorized by Government department (Francis et al. 2002). Studies reported higher abundance and species richness of commercially important fishes in some of the studied protected areas in the region (McClanahan and Arthus 2001). The build-up of these large species may reduce the abundance of small wrasses such as C. oxycephalus (McClanahan et al. 1999). 'None'theless, these protected areas may offer protection to C. oxycephalus, however its occurrence within these areas needs further investigation. MozambiqueThere is no known fishery management or regulations on this species in Mozambique. There is a 22 km<sup>2</sup> marine reserve, two national parks and one wildlife sanctuary where coastal waters are protected (Francis et al. 2002, Wells et al. 2007). A fish survey in 2000 at various locations including marine protected areas did not record this species (Motta et al. 2002). The occurrence of this species within these areas needs further investigation. MadagascarThis species was reported from the Natural Reserve of the Glorieuses Islands (Durville et al. 2003). Labrids are not major catches in the reef fishes surrounding the south-west Madagascar in 1997 (Laroche et al. 1997), and catch-per-unit-effort is still relatively high in these fishing grounds. There are two marine protected areas, with no-take zones, located in the northwest region of Madagascar (McKenna and Allen 2005). The occurrence of this species within these areas needs further investigation. Fishery management or regulations are lacking.SeychellesSeveral marine protected areas are established in Seychelles, which covers over 220 km<sup>2</sup>, however enforcement and regulations within them are suggested to be very weak (Francis et al. 2002). Occurrence of C. oxycephalus within these areas is unknown. Fisheries operating in Seychelles, both artisanal and semi-industrial fisheries, are regulated by licensing system and mesh-size limit, and compliance to these regulations is maintained through regular patrols (Seychelles Fishing Authority 2008). ComorosOne marine protected area is found in Comoros (Francis et al. 2002), within which no-take areas are set up (Granek and Brown 2005). Co-management between government and local villages is adopted to regulate fisheries within the area. (Granek and Brown 2005). The occurrence of this species within the marine protected areas needs further investigation. Fishery management and regulation are not known. KenyaFishery management and regulation are not known. Several marine protected areas are established and fishing activities are regulated (Francis et al. 2002). Studies reported higher abundance and species richness of commercially important fishes in some of the studied protected areas in the region (McClanahan and Arthus 2001, McClanahan et al. 2007). However, the occurrence of this species within the marine protected areas needs further investigation. South AfricaAbout 20 marine protected areas are established which encompass various habitat types and offer various level of protection to fish through zoning (e.g. no-take zone, controlled fishing zone) (Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 2008, SouthAfrica.info 2008). These protected areas represent about 18% of coastline in South Africa (WWF 2004). Although C. oxycephalus has not been reported from recent ichthyofaunal surveys in some of these marine protected areas (Wood et al. 2000, Mann et al. 2006), the relatively large area of coastline and the representation of various habitat types within this marine protected area network is likely to encompasses locations utilized by C. oxycephalus in South Africa. Western Pacific IslandsThere is no known fishery management on this species in Fiji, Tonga or Samoa. One and nine marine protected areas are established in Fiji and Tonga respectively (WWF 2006, Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2007a). While in Samoa, two marine protected areas, covering 140 and 100 km<sup>2</sup>, are established and are co-managed between villagers and the government (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2007b, Conservation International 2008). The distribution of C. oxycephalus among Western Pacific Islands implies that the newly established Phoenix Island Protected Area in Kiribati, which is currently the largest marine protected area in the world, may provide protection to this species (Phoenix Island Protected Area 2007). However, occurrence data of this species within these marine protected areas are lacking.PalauThere are seasonal ban, gear restriction on fishing and a licensing system for aquarium fish collection, but there is no specific management on this species (Secretariat of the Pacific Community and Bureau of Marine Resources 2007). Several marine protected areas are in place but the occurrence of this species within these areas is unknown (Golbuu 2005). Papua New GuineaThere is no information on fishery management. The Kimbe Bay marine protected area may provide protection to this species (The Nature Conservancy 2008) but further investigation is needed.AustraliaWestern AustraliaSeveral marine parks and reserves, which have various level of fishing or no fishing, are established within Western Australia (Department of Environment and Conservation 2008). However the occurrence of C. oxycephalus within these marine parks and reserves is unknown.

Marine parks are in place (Northern Territory Government 2007). However the occurrence of C. oxycephalus within these marine parks and reserves is unknown. QueenslandMarine parks are established within Queensland including the well-know Great Barrier Reef. Marine parks are zoned for different purposes and offer different levels of protection from recreational and commercial fishing activities (Environmental Protection Agency 2008). For fishery management, a minimum size of 250 mm TL and a bag limit of 5 fish apply to all wrasses (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2008a). There are three, nine-day closure to the taking of all coral reef fishes in Queensland east coast waters, which are in October, November and December each year around the new moon phase (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2008b). There is no specific management measure or regulation on this species in commercial food fish fishery. This species is collected as part of the international aquarium fish trade in Queensland. Both recreational and licensed commercial aquarium fish collectors are allowed to operate within certain zones in the Great Barrier Reef (Ryan and Clarke 2005). While SCUBA and hookah are allowed for commercial collectors, recreational collectors can only use mask and snorkel for collecting aquarium fish. There are also gear restrictions (only by hands, small fishing lines or seine-nets) and bag limits (20 fish per person) on aquarium fish collection for both recreational and commercial collectors (Ryan and Clarke 2005). There is no specific management or regulation on C. oxycephalus. New CaledoniaMarine reserves are established within the natural range of C. oxycephalus (Wantiez et al. 1997) These reserves cover reef habitat which are suitable to C. oxycephalus (Lieske and Myers 1994). Though this species has not been recorded within these reserves, it is very likely that these no-take areas can provide protection to this C. oxycephalus. Regulation on either commercial or recreational fishing is lacking.MaldivesThere are management measures for shark and tuna fisheries, also a licensing system within some areas, however management measure is lacking for many other reef fisheries except for the export bans on rare species (Adam 2006). Marine protected areas are established, fishing is prohibited except for the traditional live bait fishing (Ministry of Hone Affairs, Housing and Environment 2003).Mainland ChinaThere is very limited information about the fisheries in Mainland China. There are seasonal protected area, mesh size limit in some fisheries, however enforcement is suggested to be weak (Chen 1999).JapanThere is no fishery management or regulations on this species in Japan. About 60 marine parks (with no-fishing areas and buffer zones) are established in Japan (UNEP-WCMC 2008) but occurrence data of this species within these areas need further investigation.TaiwanThere is no fishery management or regulations on this species in Taiwan. C. oxycephalus occurs within the Kenting National Park (Shao 2005). Its recorded occurrence in Tung Sha Tao (Pratas Island), which is now a protected area, offer protection to this species (Chen et al. 1995).PhilippinesThere is no fishery management or regulation specific for the fin-fish fishery. There are over 400 marine protected areas, within which no-take zone, regulated fishing zones are established (Haribon Foundation 2002). And these areas may allow the build-up of reef fishes (Russ and Alcala 1998). This species may occur within these areas but further investigation is needed.VietnamFishermen have to be licensed and there are certain gear size and type restrictions, and seasonal closures but no specific fishery management for reef fisheries, however enforcement of these regulations are suggested to be weak (Flewwelling and Hosch 2007a). There are marine protected areas in Vietnam but information on enforcement is not available. IndiaFishery management seems lacking. There are about 30 marine protected areas in India encompassing various habitat types, however details of the enforcement and occurrence of species is lacking (Singh 2003)IndonesiaThere are licensing system, gear type restrictions, limited entry and total allowable catches for artisanal and coastal fisheries (Flewwelling and Hosch 2007b). Commercial fisheries such as the purse seine fisheries are not formally managed (Flewwelling and Hosch 2007b). There are marine protected areas in Indonesia but the occurrence of this species within these areas needs further investigation.","This species is sometimes caught for the aquarium trade and is rarely utilized as food fish.

(Grouper & Wrasse Red List Authority)",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,108,4592,None,"The Humphead Wrasse is widely distributed but is nowhere common, naturally. Densities rarely exceed 20 fish per hectare in the preferred habitats of outer reefs; more typically not more than 10. Wherever it is fished, even if only moderately, density quickly declines to 25% or less of peak densities recorded at no fishing – this is known from 24 different studies based on fishery-independent data from 11 range states (Sadovy et al. 2003). It appears to be extirpated from several edge of range locations (Sadovy et al. 2003). It is particularly heavily exploited (i.e., high levels of fishing pressure) at the centre of its range in southeastern Asia where its coral reef habitat is most abundant, and particularly in key supply countries for the live reef fish trade, Malaysia and Indonesia, and out of Palawan, its stronghold in the Philippines. In these countries all available fishery-dependent and trade-related data suggest declines over 10–15 years in exploited areas of 10–fold or more with fish now considered rare in areas where once it was common. Buyers of this fish are continually having to source new areas as numbers decline and the pattern of fishing reported is one typical of rapid serial depletions. Much of the capture in all major source countries for live fish are of small fish, mainly juveniles, according to all reliable accounts. Moreover, juveniles are the preferred size range for retailers of live Humphead Wrasse. Severe declines have also been noted nationally wherever the species is taken by speargun at night. Such is the concern for this species that it is one of the only reef fish protected by name (i.e., species name) across a range of countries. It is everywhere accessible to live fish catcher boats which can visit the most remote locations at will. Some spawning aggregations have been noted to decline or have disappeared in eastern Malaysia and Australia. The total global catch of this species is estimated to be no more than 400 mt annually (Sadovy et al. 2003), yet despite this low volume, severe declines are noted in all places for which data are available and occurring very soon after fishing begins, reducing numbers by more than 50% (see country accounts and summary table) (both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent) and where management is not effective. Much of the trade is now in juvenile fish which is the preferred market size for live fish. It is severely reduced anywhere that it is fished unless a) it is effectively managed, b) there is no export trade or night spearfishing, and c) it is not included in marine protected areas. It is a species that appears to be highly conservation-dependent . There is no regional fishery management authority for this species and FAO does not collect data on it. The listing of this species as Endangered is based on a population reduction of at least 50% over the last three generations (approximately 30 years) based on an index of abundance and actual or potential levels of exploitation (A2bd). The declines are predicted to continue or even accelerate because of the likely growth of the live fish export trade (A3bd). This species can live at least 30 years (25 for males and 32 for females) and becomes sexually mature at six years (J.H. Choat, C.R. Davies, J. Ackerman and B.D. Mapstone, unpublished manuscript). This means that its generation time is expected to be in the order of 10 years and that the rate of intrinsic population increase is likely to be low; natural predators are few and natural mortality rate was determined to be 0.14 or less (J.H. Choat, C.R. Davies, J. Ackerman and B.D. Mapstone, unpublished manuscript). The species is particularly vulnerable because the bulk of the fishery for live fish, at least in east Malaysia, southwest Philippines and Indonesia (the major suppliers for the live reef fish trade and the centre of the species’ range) is selective for juvenile sized fish since this is the preferred size class for consumers and gains the highest prices. This selective fishery for animals below but close to the size of sexual maturation has the potential to severely reduce the reproductive capability of exploited populations. The species cannot be artificially cultured (i.e., hatchery produced) to relieve fishing pressure. The declines are projected to continue or worsen in key source countries for live fish because: a) The species is one of the two most highly valued fish, economically, in the luxury live reef fish trade on a per kg basis; b) Of the probable intrinsic vulnerability of such a large and long-lived reef fish, that is also hermaphroditic with relatively few adult males, and an aggregation-spawner, to overfishing; and c) In places where the species has declined but is still actively sought, fishers only find a few fish a month or a year, at most; d) The projected growth in the live fish trade, especially into mainland China in the next few years. Finally, despite regulations in many places, there is much illegal, unregulated and unmonitored trade, according to many verbal accounts by fishers and traders and there is no regional management authority actively engaged in managing this small fishery and FAO does not collect data on it. It only remains abundant where protected or not fished at all. Protective legislation in most places appears to be ineffective. See the Supplementary Material for a summary of the population data derived from fishery-indepent and fishery dependent sources.","The Humphead Wrasse is widely distributed on coral reefs and inshore habitats throughout much of the tropical Indo-Pacific, from western Indian Ocean and Red Sea to southern Japan, New Caledonia and into the central Pacific Ocean (see the Supplementary Material for a distribution map). In Australia, it occurs on offshore reefs of north-western Australia and the Great Barrier Reef (Pogonoski et al. 2002). It is rare in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef in the Capricorn-Bunker Group (Russell 1983) and at Middleton and Elizabeth Reef (Gill and Reader 1992). This species appears to occur predominantly at depths of less than 100 m. It is not known from the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Island, Easter Island, Pitcairn Is., Rapa or Lord Howe Islands, Kermadec or Australes Is., and evidently does not occur in the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, Reunion Is., Mauritius or Rodrigues Is. Adults are known to occur largely on outer reef areas, often in association with channels and passes. Spawning aggregation sites have been reported from outer reef areas.","Abundance estimates on northern Queensland (Australia) reefs are 2.5–3.5 adults per 8000 m² (Choat in Pogonosky et al. 2002).nnThere are no data on total numbers of this fish globally. However, adults are largely limited to outer reef areas which are a small proportion of the total reef area within its distribution and, even in preferred habitats, densities are very low for a commercially exploited species (rarely &gt; 10 fish per 10,000 square meter when not fished). It is considered uncommon to rare naturally. Nothing is known about the extent of subpopulations or degree of fragmentation but available suitable habitat is a major determinant of its distribution. Some edge of range extirpations are suspected.nnThe species is hermaphroditic, changing sex from female to male. The sex ratio of samples and fish observed in the field is female biased. Under IUCN criteria for mature individuals, there should be a correction made to factor in the sex bias which effectively reduces substantially the estimates of fish numbers included in this assessment.",decreasing,"In one study, small post-settlement humphead wrasses were found in a species of seagrass (Enhalys acoroides), four species of hard coral (three Acropora spp. and Porites cylindricus), and in the soft coral Sarcophyton sp. (branching form; M.A. Tupper, pers. comm.). After settlement, juveniles and adults live associated with reef or near-reef habitats of seagrass beds and mangrove areas, with juveniles typically inshore and the largest individuals found in deeper waters of outer reefs or lagoons (Myers 1999). Juveniles of 3–20 cm TL, and larger, occur in coral-rich areas of lagoon reefs, particularly among live thickets of staghorn, Acropora spp. corals, in seagrass beds, murky outer river areas with patch reefs, shallow sandy areas adjacent to coral reef lagoons, and mangrove and seagrass areas inshore (Randall 1955, Randallet al. 1978, Myers 1999, J.H. Choat, pers. comm.). Recruitment patterns may vary considerably between years (M.A. Tupper, unpublished data). Adults are more common offshore than inshore, their presumed preferred habitat being steep outer reef slopes, reef drop-offs, reef tops, channel slopes, reef passes, and lagoon reefs to at least 100 m. They are usually found in association with well-developed coral reefs (Vivien 1973, Randall et all. 1978, Winterbottom et al. 1989, Allen and Swainston 1992, Sluka 2000). Typically they are solitary or paired, but have also been noted in groups of 3–7 individuals (Donaldson 1995). They appear to be somewhat sedentary in that the same individuals, indentifiable by distinct natural markings, may be seen along the same stretch of reef for extended periods. Indeed, many commercial dive sites have their ‘resident’ Humphead Wrasse, a favoured species for divers. Natural densities are evidently never high, even in presumed preferred habitats. For example, in unfished or lightly fished areas, densities may range from two to rarely more than 10–20 individuals per 10,000 m² of suitable reef. In fished areas, however, densities are typically lower by tenfold or more, and in some places fish no longer appear to be present.nnAccounts of reproductive activity in the field reveal that, depending on location, this species spawns between several and all months of the year, in small or large groupings, that spawning coincides with certain phases of the tidal cycle, and that groups of spawning fish can form daily, at a range of different reef types. Spawning areas and aggregated adults have been noted regularly along specific sections of reef, sometimes associated with no obvious topographical features, sometimes close to the shelf edge on outer reefs, or adjacent to exposed reef passes near fairly steep drop-offs, or on mid-shelf (unspecified) reefs (P.L. Colin, J.H. Choat, R. Hamilton, S. Oakley, pers. comms.). The species is evidently a daily spawner that probably does not migrate far to its spawning site(s), spawning for extended periods each year, i.e., a ‘resident’ spawner (Domeier and Colin 1997, P.L. Colin, pers. comm.): groups of up to 150 fish were observed in Palau along the shelf edge in a loose aggregation.nnProbable spawning aggregations have also been noted on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Fiji, New Caledonia, and in the Solomon Islands. Although spawning was not always observed, aggregated fish were ripe, or exhibiting behaviour likely associated with spawning. On the GBR, aggregations of up to 10 large males and 20–50 smaller fish (35–95 cm TL) were noted (J.H. Choat, pers. comm.). GBR aggregations from the Ribbon Reefs and north of Jewell Reef, once noted to include hundreds of fish, are no longer known at the same sites (Johannes and Squire 1988, L. Squire, pers. comm.).nnThe longevity of this species is up to at least 32 years, with females outliving the males (the oldest female recorded was 32 years), and sexual maturity is reached at about eight years of age (Choat in Pogonosky et al. 2002). Histological studies show that sexual maturation is reached at a size of between 40 cm and 60 cm total length (Sadovy, unpublished data). This species is thought to be a protogynous hermaphrodite, with sex reversal occurring at about 15 years of age (Choat in Pogonosky et al. 2002). At a total length of approximately 111 cm (Lau and Li 2000). Males grow very rapidly (Choat in Pogonosky et al. 2002).nnIt feeds on a variety of molluscs, fishes, sea urchins, crustaceans and other invertebrates (Randall et al. 1997).","Threats include: 1) Intensive and species-specific removal for the live reef food fish export trade of a naturally uncommon and vulnerable species; 2) Readily accessible to spearfishing at night with SCUBA or hookah (i.e., compressed air) gear, and easy to catch with cyanide, or other poisons such as Derris trifoliata, due to predictable adult habitat and shallow depth range; 3) Lack of coordinated, consistent national and regional management largely due to limited management capacity and the sometime secretive nature of traders – in particular there is no relevant regional fishery management authority to address problems with this species; 4) Selective fishing, in particular the intensive take of juveniles for direct export sale and for grow-out (also referred to as ‘culture’ – the species cannot be hatchery reared; and 5) Illegal, unregulated, or unreported (IUU) fisheries (Donaldson and Sadovy 2001). In addition, the species’ essential coral reef habitat is seriously threatened by human activity throughout the Indo-Pacific region. Destructive fishing practices, such as sodium cyanide use which stuns animals for capture and incidentally kills living coral, have been well documented and are spreading in the Indo-Pacific region (Barber and Pratt 1998, Burke et al. 2002, Bryant et al. 1998, Johannes and Riepen 1995). Despite its prohibition in many countries (including major exporters such as the Philippines and Indonesia), cyanide is still the preferred method for capturing certain live reef fish for international trade in some areas (Burke et al. 2002, Bryant et al. 1998, Johannes and Riepen 1995, Barber and Pratt 1998). Indeed, larger Humphead Wrasse are difficult to catch any other way, other than by night-time capture. When cyanide is applied, the fish often retreats into a crevice and becomes increasingly lethargic as the toxin reduces its ability to take up oxygen. Divers may break away the living coral to get access to the hiding area, and remove the fish to clean water where it will often recover for shipment or holding in net pens. The most serious threat to this species is overfishing for the live fish export trade. They are mainly taken live for food – only rarely for the aquarium trade as far as can be determined. This species is long-lived and naturally uncommon, and if it is similar to other reef fishes of similar size and biology (e.g., sequential hermaphroditism; aggregation-spawner) it is expected to have low rates of replacement and therefore be particularly vulnerable to fishing pressure (Donaldson and Sadovy 2001). Moreover, being one of the largest of all reef fishes, they have few natural predators which means that fishing mortality may rapidly exceed natural mortality, possibly accounting for the rapid declines noted once fishing intensifies. Although data are not available from throughout its range, wherever there are significant exports and no effective controls, fish numbers have declined substantially within a decade or less and exploitation rates are expected to continue, or more likely, intensify. There are few refuges for this species since live reef fish carriers have access to all reefs where it occurs and it does not extend into very deep water, probably little more than 60 m. Adults only occur in reasonable numbers where the fishery is effectively managed or where they occur in marine protected areas. There has been speculation that Humphead Wrasse, and other reef fishes, can be cultured or 'farmed' to meet international demand. However, it appears that the use of cultured fish may actually pose a threat to wild populations in certain circumstances since it does not involve hatchery production (not yet possible for this species and unlikely to be possible at commercial levels for many years according to experienced aquarist M.A. Rimmer, pers. comm.) but the grow-out of wild sourced juveniles.","Australia Western Australia – complete protection since May 1998 because stocks determined to be insufficient and susceptible to overfishing. From December 1st, 2003, Coral Reef Fin Fish Management Plan (for Queensland waters, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) prohibited all take and possession of Humphead Wrasse, other than for limited educational purposes and public display. China Permits are required for the sale of this species in Guangzhou province, southern mainland China – for conservation purposes. Indonesia Fishing permitted if: - Done by researcher (with research permit) for the purpose of scientific and mariculture development, as well as by artisanal fishers (with specific fishing permit). - Allowable weights are 1 to 3 kg. Fish with weight less than 1 kg and more than 3 kg should be used for mariculture and/or freed to nature. - Allowable fishing methods for catching humphead wrasse are hook and line, fish trap and gill net. - With regards to artisanal fishers involve in fisheries business partnership, the fishers should sell the fish to its collector partners. - Collector and exporters should develop a rearing and culturing facility in the collection site which is equipped with staff knowledgeable in reef fish culture. - Provincial Fisheries Services much monitor, control and report on permits and volumes 3-monthly but no data were available despite multiple queries and are apparently not collected. Maldives All exports ofumphead Wrasse were banned in 1995, largely due to concern for recreational diving, a sector that values this species. Niue The interference, take, kill, or bringing to shore of the Humphead Wrasse is prohibited without written approval. Palau Illegal to fish, buy or sell humphead wrasse &lt; 64 cm TL. Illegal to export Humphead Wrasse irrespective of size. Papua New Guinea There is a 65 cm minimum size limit for exporting Humphead Wrasse but this does not prevent fishers from catching and holding smaller Humphead Wrasse in cages (culturing) until they attain 65 cm TL. All live fish operators are required to obtain licenses. Philippines Exports of all live fish are technically prohibited from throughout the Philippines but this part of the code is evidently not implemented. Until recently Humphead Wrasse could not be exported from Palawan with an exemption for the taking of small fish for mariculture. The Palawan regulation is pending reconsideration. There was much illegal movement of this species outside of Palawan for subsequent export.This species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",None

However, this species is common in many parts of its range. It is moderately abundant in Hong Kong waters and was observed mostly in shallow boulders and coral areas at a depth of at least 10 m (Sadovy and Cornish 2000), but there is no quantitative data on this species in those areas. In Hong Kong, this species is also found in local markets (Situ and Sadovy 2004). In Solomon Islands, this species is moderately common (Allen 2006). Unsworth et al. (2007) found that this species is one of the most abundant seagrass fish species in the Wakatobi Marine National Park, Indonesia with a mean density of 17.9 +/- 4.2 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup> during high tide.

Only 28 individuals of C. anchorago have been recorded in the Kambing Island, East Java, Indonesia (Sumadhiharga 2006). In New Caledonia, a total of 509 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 8-12 cm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008).",unknown,"This species is found in seagrass beds and areas of mixed coral, rubble and sand of reef flats, channels and lagoons from depths of one to 25 m.This species spawns in aggregations. For example, at Palau, it aggregates to spawn along the outer edge of fringing reefs around the new and full moons of January to March (Myers 1991). The planktonic larval duration of C. anchorago was found to be 19.3 +/- 1.8 days in Palau (Victor 1986).In Hong Kong, this species was found singly, although sometimes small groups were observed, in shallow boulder and coral areas in a depth of at least 10 m (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). In Micronesia, it was observed in rubble or sandy areas, seagrass beds and areas of mixed coral, rubble and sand of reef flats, channels and lagoon at a depth of 25 m (Myers 1991). In Australia, it inhabits reef crests and slopes with algae and soft corals. Juveniles occur inshore and often form small aggregations in seagrass beds where near mangrove or freshwater run-offs (Lieske and Myers 1994, Kuiter 1992, 2000). In the Solomon Islands, this species is moderately common and usually found in slity areas (Allen 2006).An enlarged canine is present on each side at rear of upper jaw and lateral line continuous smoothly curved with 29 pored scales. This species is distinctive and can be recognized by a large rectangular white saddle situated dorsally on caudal peduncle extending forward below rear of the dorsal fin (Kuiter 2000, Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001, Westneat 2001). The body colour undergoes very little change and does not change much according to size or age (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). Adults are territorial (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001) and feed primarily on hard-shelled invertebrate prey such as crustaceans, molluscs, crabs , sea urchins (Tedman 1980, Ferry-Graham et al. 2002) and fishes (Bellwood et al. 2006). This species has been observed to use its large teeth to pick up rocks and search for prey beneath (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). Maximum size of this species is 38 cm SL (Allen 2000, Westneat 2001) and population doubling time is approximately 4.5-14years (Froese and Pauly).","There are no major threats known to this species. However, this species is one of the most common of the genus found in the locally-sourced live food fish trade. For instance, it is taken by hook-and-line, fish traps, monofilament nets or with spears by divers (Ishizuka et al. 1996, Westneat 2001) and turns up sporadically in markets particularly during summer months (Sadovy and Cornish 2000) or being exported for international trade (Ishizuka et al. 1996). However, the levels of fishing pressure and landing fishery data for this species are not known.Furthermore, it has been reported to form spawning aggregations during the spawning season (Myers 1991), such grouping behaviour might put the species vulnerable to any kind of fishing pressure and increasing the possibility of permanent loss of the population from a particular site since heavily fishing on a specific spawning aggregation could have taken the entire adult population over a very short time period (Sadovy and Domeier 2005). However, the targeted of spawning aggregations of this species has not been reported.The majority of Choerodon captured by western Australia commercial fishes are reported as “Choerodon spp.” (Penn et al. 2005) which making the catch statistics to be under-representative of the real landings of this species. The commercial landing weight for Choerodon spp. in western Australia is approximately, 28 t each month and in New South Wales, about 69 t of mixed species (wrasse, tuskfish and gropers) were collected commercially in a one year period (NSW Department of Primary Industries 2005).This species is occasionally taken for the marine aquarium trade (Westneat 2001). It is marketed for export from Queensland, small size is valued at USD  AUD 12, and medium and large sizes at USD  AUD 16.5 (Ryan and Clarke 2005).","There are no species-specific conservation measures for this species. However, this species distribution includes several Marine Protected Areas within its range.This species has been observed in the Ningaloon Marine Park which includes both a sanctuary for no-take and recreation zones for anglers (Westera et al. 2003). Also, it was observed in the Wakatobi Marine Park, Indonesia (Unsworth et al. 2007), Marine protected area of Nha Trang Bay, Vietnam (Dung 2007), Masinloc marine protected areas, the Philippines (IW:LEARN 2008), the Great Barrier Reef, Tung Ping Chau Marine Park and Cape d’ Aguilar (Cornish 2000). It is worth noting that the marine park doesn’t imply as a no-take zone since limited fishing activity is allowed within certain marine parks, such as Tung Ping Chau Marine Park, Hong Kong. Cage trap or monofilament nets are still allowed within the Tung Ping Chau Marine Park for licensed fishers (AFCD 2007). Furthermore, illegal and destructive fishing activities have been reported in the many Southeast Asian countries (IW:LEARN 2008) due to the poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced (Chou et al. 2002). Thus, such protected areas might provide insufficient protection to the species.In Queensland, recreational fishing for reef fish for personal home aquariums is allowed, but currently, there is no information available on the level of recreational harvest of marine aquarium species. Only licensed fishermen are allowed to capture fishes for aquarium trade in Australia and in Queensland, the total number of fishes harvested for the ornamental fish fishery approximately 140,000 in 1991 involving about 150 species, 240,000 in 1995, 140,000 in 1997, 2,108,345 annually (1998-2003) (MCS 2001, Ryan and Clarke 2005).In Queensland, the minimum legal size for tuskfish (Choerodon spp.) is 30 cm and daily bag limit is five in total for all Choerodon species per angler, in addition, closed season for fishing applies to coral reef finfish (Queensland Government).","This species is marketed mostly fresh and is occasionally found in aquarium trade (Westneat 2001).

Hutchins, Western Australian Museum, pers. comm.). This species has high quality white flesh and is captured by commercial and recreational fishers in the north-western regions (Gascoyne and Pilbara/Kimberley) of Western Australia (W.A.). It is marketed in Perth, either as whole fish or fillets, and labeled as 'baby groper' after its commercially sought-after congeneric, the Baldchin Groper Choerodon rubescens (D. Thorburn, Seafresh Fish Markets, pers. comm.).nnChanges to fishing regulations for tuskfish in 2003 for the west coast and Gascoyne coast regions of Western Australia (W.A.) limit their capture to fish ≥ 40 cm in length (total length) and to a maximum of four fish per person per day (for recreational fishers). Since C. cauteroma rarely reaches more than 40 cm in length, these regulations essentially protect this species from capture in those two regions. Regulations for the Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A. are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west and Gascoyne regions of W.A. In the Pilbara/Kimberley region there is currently no minimum legal length for C. cauteroma and the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day.nnChoerodon cauteroma should be considered Least Concern due to the minimum size limit for tuskfish species of 40 cm in Western Australia. This essentially protects this species from capture, since it rarely reaches this size, however, changes to regulations may occur in the future to reflect increased knowledge of the biology of this species (Fairclough in prep.). Since this species has a relatively limited range, it should be reassessed in the future for any changes in commercial or recreational catch composition, particularly if fishing regulations change or if an export market develops, that may ultimately have undesirable impacts on the population structure.","Choerodon cauteroma occurs on coastal and inshore reefs between the Houtman–Abrolhos Islands (a group of islands and reefs ca 70 km offshore at ca 28º45'S, 113º45'E), on the west coast of Australia and the Dampier Peninsula (16º23'S, 122º55'E), on the north-west coast (Hutchins 2001). The Houtman-Abrolhos Islands is in the vicinity of the path of the southward-flowing Leeuwin Current (Hatcher 1991). This current carries the eggs and larvae of tropical species southwards along the Western Australian continental shelf (Hutchins 1991). The Leeuwin current is likely to be the main reason for individuals of C. cauteroma being recorded in the Abrolhos Islands, since it is considered to be rare at this location and this species was not recorded by Hutchins (2001) during surveys of inshore coastal reefs south of Shark Bay (ca 26ºS, 113.5ºE) (Hutchins 2001).nnOne individual specimen was sighted in a fish market in Jakarta, Indonesia (W. White, Murdoch University, pers. comm.), however, this specimen may have been captured in waters closer to the Australian mainland.","Choerodon cauteroma is abundant in Shark Bay (Hutchins et al. 1995, Hutchins 2001, Fairclough et al. unpubl. data). Visual surveys in South Passage, at the southern end of Dirk Hartog Island, Shark Bay, the eastern coastlines of Bernier and Dorre Islands, and sites in the eastern and western gulfs of Shark Bay suggest that C. cauteroma is abundant in these areas (Hutchins 1990, Hutchins 2001, Travers and Potter 2002, Fairclough in prep.). Surveys by Hutchins (2001) demonstrated that C. cauteroma was occasionally or frequently observed at sites between Shark Bay and the Dampier Archipelago and that it was frequently observed at sites on the Dampier Peninsula, but was not recorded to the east of that peninsula. Furthermore, it was not recorded at any of the offshore atolls surveyed, i.e., Rowley Shoals, Scott Reef and Ashmore reef. Research sampling by Fisheries Western Australia using traps and trawl nets along the north-west (Pilbara/Kimberley) coast of Australia collected moderate numbers of C. cauteroma, suggesting a fairly continuous distribution along this coast (Newman et al. 2003). Catches declined rapidly only a short distance north of Broome, which is in agreement with the results of the surveys of Hutchins (2001).nnChoerodon cauteroma does not occur in catches of tuskfish species in the Northern Territory (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.).",unknown,"Choerodon cauteroma is a demersal species and is common in shallow waters (&lt; 15 m). However, it has been captured in waters up to 30 m deep (Newman et al. 2003). It is most abundant on rocky platform reefs, coral reefs and on sand or rubble areas associated with rocky or coral reefs (Hutchins et al. 1995, Allen 1999, Hutchins 2003, Fairclough in prep.). In Shark Bay, juveniles and adults are found on seagrass beds (Travers and Potter 2002, Fairclough et al. unpubl. data). Small juveniles (&lt; ca 150 mm) use weedy rock or seagrass habitats as nursery areas and generally move onto reefs after the first 1–2 years of life, where they mature (Fairclough in prep.). Some adults remain or may move between seagrass and reef areas (Fairclough in prep.).nnC. cauteroma is a protogynous hermaphrodite and is an indeterminate multiple spawner. It spawns between April and November in Shark Bay, although spawning fish are most abundant between September and November, i.e., spring (Fairclough in prep.). Relatively small male gonads indicate that male fish would spawn with only one to a few females at once. Spawning fish have been collected in the many individual reef habitats occupied by this species in Shark Bay and it is unlikely that this species forms large spawning aggregations, but more than likely spawns in small groups, as is typical of many labrids (Fairclough in prep.).","Changes in commercial and/or recreational fishing pressure are the main threats to this species. However, there is no information on the level of exploitation of this species in Western Australia. Historical data on commercial catches in reports of the Department of Fisheries Western Australia combine all tuskfish species as one group, i.e., tuskfish, other than Choerodon rubescens. Thus, the contribution by C. cauteroma to these catches is unknown. Catches of tuskfish between 1994/95 and 1998/99 ranged from 16 to 34 t per year (Research Services Division 2000).","Changes to fishing regulations for tuskfish in 2003 for the west coast and Gascoyne coast regions of Western Australia (W.A.) limit the capture of C. cauteroma to fish ≥ 40 cm in length (total length) and to a maximum of four fish per person per day (for recreational fishers) (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b). Since C. cauteroma rarely reaches more than 40 cm in length (Fairclough in prep.), these regulations essentially protect this species from capture in those two regions. However, the minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm has not been set based on any knowledge of the biology of this species, since there is currently no information published. Thus, the MLL for this species may be changed once the results of Fairclough (in prep.) become available.nnIn the Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A., there is currently no MLL for retention of C. cauteroma and the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003c). These regulations are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west and Gascoyne regions of W.A.nnAlthough, in the future, the MLL may change in all regions of W.A. where C. cauteroma occurs, to reflect more knowledge of the biology of this species, the catch limit is unlikely to be increased, since these limits are based on the type of life history that a particular species has. Thus, tuskfish are included in the category of 'highest risk' (Harrison 2001). Species in this category are generalised as having the following characteristics: they are long-lived, slow-growing, they mature at four years plus, form semi-resident populations, are vulnerable to localised depletion due to their life history, or are of low abundance or highly targeted (Harrison 2001).nnIn Shark Bay, four sanctuary (no take) zones, i.e., South Passage, Mary Anne Island, Sandy Point and the Gudrun wreck, encompass habitats occupied by C. cauteroma (Anonymous 1996, Hutchins 1990, Fairclough in prep.). There are eight no take sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. Spearfishing of tuskfish is prohibited throughout this marine park (Anonymous (2004).nnProposals are currently being considered for new marine parks on the north-west coast of Western Australia, including the Dampier Archipelago and Montebello Islands, where C. cauteroma is found (Hutchins 2001, Penn 2002). Marine Parks in Western Australia do not necessarily imply 'no take' zones, but may include no take zones within their boundaries or restrictions on bag limits or methods used for capture.",None

(Hutchins 2001). It is a recreational and possibly a commercial target in W.A., although it is not a widely captured species, since it rarely reaches the current minimum legal total length for capture of 40 cm in that state (Fairclough in prep., Newman et al. 2003, Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a,b,c). Annual commercial catches of tuskfish are reported as a combined category, i.e., 'tuskfish', not as individual species in Western Australia. Choerodon cyanodus is recognized as a recreational target in Queensland, however, less so than its congeneric Choerodon venustus, and catches are suggested to be low (J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Commercial catches of labrids and scarids in Queensland are grouped as ‘parrots’, hence the total catch levels of C. cyanodus in this region are unclear, but are likely to be low (J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Levels of exploitation in Australia are thus likely to be low.nnLevels of abundance and commercial or recreational exploitation in other areas of the distribution of C. cyanodus are unclear. Catch statistics are not available for many countries throughout south-east Asia. However, with destructive methods, such as explosives and poisons, used commonly in areas such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, the occurrence of localized depletions may be widespread (Chou et al. 2002).nnAs the majority of the global population of C. cyanodus is likely to be in Australia (see Range below), this global assessment is based primarily on the situation there. Since annual catches of C. cyanodus are low throughout Australia and suitable fishing regulations are in place, this species would be considered least concern in that country. Furthermore, although its distribution is suggested to be wide in south-east Asia (Allen 1999), other studies do not report the occurrence of C. cyanodus in many areas of that region, e.g., Masuda et al. 1984, Monkolprasit et al. 1997, Werner and Allen 1998, Allen and Adrim 1993, and thus records of this species in those regions are likely to be erroneous or it is of low abundance. While fishing or major habitat loss (in SE Asian areas of its distribution) may be responsible for some population decline, it is not expected to be 30% or greater, or to get much worse in the foreseeable future,, and therefore this species does not meet any of the threatened criteria and should be considered least concern on a global scale.","In Western Australia, Choerodon cyanodus occurs as far south as the Houtman-Abrolhos Islands (a group of islands and reefs ca. 70 km offshore at ca. 28º45'S, 113º45'E), however, it is considered to be rare at this location (Hutchins 2001). The Houtman-Abrolhos Islands is in the vicinity of the path of the southward-flowing Leeuwin Current (Hatcher 1991). This current carries the eggs and larvae of tropical species southwards along the Western Australian continental shelf (Hutchins 1991). The Leeuwin current is likely to be the main reason for individuals of C. cyanodus being recorded in the Abrolhos Islands, since it is considered to be rare at this location and this species was not recorded by Hutchins (2001) during surveys of inshore coastal reefs south of Shark Bay (ca. 26ºS, 113.5ºE) (Hutchins 2001).nnSurveys by Hutchins (2001, 2003) and Newman et al. (2003) demonstrate that C. cyanodus occurs along the northern Pilbara/Kimberley coastline of Western Australia as far north as Wyndham (15º29'S, 128º7'E), but not on the offshore atolls along this coast, i.e., Rowley Shoals, Scott Reef and Ashmore reef. While this species’ distribution is reported to extend along the coastline of northern Australia, data suggests that fishing tour operators in Darwin do not catch C. cyanodus (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.). However, tuskfish in commercial catches are often combined and labeled ‘parrots’ in this region. Choerodon cyanodus occurs along the Queensland coastline around the Gulf of Carpentaria, Cape York Peninsula and on the Great Barrier Reef, and has previously been studied at Heron Island (Choat, 1969). Choat (1969) suggests that this species occurs as far south as ca. 24ºS on the east coast of Australia.nnChoerodon species reported to occur in Sri Lanka by the FAO do not include C. cyanodus, however, if it does occur in this area as suggested by Allen (1999), it seems likely to be present only in low numbers or in restricted areas and this would represent the westerly limit of its distribution (De Bruin et al. 1994). Choerodon cyanodu is also reported by divers to occur along the Thailand coastline (Anonymous 2004a) but does not appear in extensive lists of species from that country (Monkolprasit et al. 1997), or other areas outside Australia where it is reported to occur, notably Indonesia (Papua to Sumatra; Allen and Adrim 2003), Japan (Masuda et al. 1984) and Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea (Werner and Allen 1998). It appears that either records of this species outside Australia, are largely in error, or abundance in these areas is very low. This global assessment is, therefore, based primarily on populations in Australia which are likely to comprise the majority of the global population.","Choerodon cyanodus is rare at the Houtman-Abrolhos Islands, which represent the lower limit of this species’ distribution in Western Australia (Hutchins 2001). Surveys by Hutchins (2001, 2003) and research sampling by Newman et al. (2003) found this species to be abundant at locations northwards from the north west cape of Western Australia, however, Fairclough (in prep.) found that this species was also abundant in many areas of Shark Bay to the south.nnIt is probably equally abundant along the Queensland coastline as this area is well within its geographic range, and since it does not feature prominently in commercial or recreational catches (J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Distribution along the western and eastern coastlines of Australia is likely to be fairly continuous within its range, due to similar habitat being available throughout. The degree of fragmentation of its distribution and levels of abundance in the Northern Territory of Australia and throughout the remainder of its geographic range in south-east Asia are unclear.",unknown,"Choerodon cyanodus is a demersal species and is abundant in shallow waters in Shark Bay (&lt; 10 m). It has been captured in waters up to 30 m deep along the Pilbara/Kimberley coast of Western Australia (Newman et al. 2003). It is found on flat bottoms and coral reefs (Allen 1999). However, it is common on rocky limestone reefs, weedy-rock areas, rocky shorelines and seagrass areas in Shark Bay (Travers and Potte 2002, Fairclough, in prep.). Juveniles and adults (&lt; ca. 200 mm) are found in weedy rock or seagrass habitats, but fish above this size are more common on reefs or rocky habitats (Fairclough in prep.). While records suggest that this species reaches 70 cm in length and recreational fishing records suggest a specimen weighing 4.5 kg was captured in Shark Bay (Australian Anglers Association, (WA Division) Inc. 2003), the majority of fish collected in Shark Bay during current research were below 30 cm and none were collected above 40 cm (Fairclough, in prep.). All fish collected by Choat (1969) from the Great Barrier Reef were &lt; 405 mm in length. Mature fish of ca. 100–150 mm have been collected in seagrass and weedy rock habitats, implying that this species may not always migrate to reefs after maturity and it may live its full lifecycle in either seagrass or reef habitats (Fairclough, in prep.).nnChoerodon cyanodus is a protogynous hermaphrodite and is an indeterminate multiple spawner. It spawns between December and February in Shark Bay, i.e., summer (Fairclough, in prep). Relatively small male gonads indicate that male fish would spawn with only one to a few females at once. Mature and spawning fish have been collected in the many individual reef and seagrass habitats occupied by this species in Shark Bay and it is unlikely that this species forms large spawning aggregations, but more than likely spawns in small groups (Fairclough, in prep.).","There is no direct information on the level of exploitation of this species throughout most of its range. A minimum legal length of 40 cm in Western Australia virtually prevents its capture, since fish caught during research in both Shark Bay and on the northwest coast of Western Australia were always under this size (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a,b,c, Fairclough in prep., Newman et al. 2003). Catches of the combined 'tuskfish' category in Western Australia are moderate (16 to 34 t per year between 1994/95 and 1998/99; Research Services Division 2000), but, since C. cyanodus is rarely larger than its MLL, it is unlikely to be significant in these catches. Although C. cyanodus is a recognized target for recreational fishers in Queensland, it is only caught in small numbers (J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.) and commercial catches of the combined category of ‘parrots’ (Labrids and Scarids) in that state are around 30 t per year, consisting mainly of Choerodon venustus, C. cyanodus is unlikely to be threatened on the east coast of Australia (J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Choerodon cyanodus is not taken in the Northern Territory of Australia (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.). Destructive fishing practices used to capture fish for local consumption, the live reef fish trade and the aquarium trade in many parts of south-east Asia, may represent the largest threat to C. cyanodus (Munday and Allen 2000, Wabnitz et al. 2003, Chou et al. 2002). However, there is no data to suggest whether C. cyanodus forms a part of any of these industries. Land clearing, and thus sedimentation from increased run-off, and poor sanitation in southeast Asian countries, such as Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, also have the potential to destroy important habitats (Munday and Allen 2000, Chou et al. 2002).","There are minimum legal lengths (MLL) for capture of C. cyanodus in Western Australia and Queensland of 40 and 30 cm, respectively, however, there are no such limits in the Northern Territory. Changes to fishing regulations for tuskfish in 2003 for the west coast and Gascoyne coast regions of Western Australia (W.A.) limit the capture of C. cyanodus to a mixed bag of four tuskfish per person per day (for recreational fishers) (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a). Since C. cyanodus rarely reaches more than 40 cm in length (Fairclough in prep.), these regulations essentially protect this species from capture in those two regions. However, the minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm has not been set based on any knowledge of the biology of this species, since there is currently no information published. In the Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A. the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003c). These regulations are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west coast and Gascoyne regions of W.A.nnAlthough, in the future, the MLL may change in all regions of W.A. where C. cyanodus occurs, to reflect more knowledge of the biology of this species (Fairclough in prep.), the catch limit is unlikely to be increased, since these limits are based on the type of life history that a particular species has. Thus, tuskfish are included in the category of 'highest risk' (Harrison 2001). Species in this category are generalised as having the following characteristics: they are long-lived, slow-growing, they mature at four years plus, form semi-resident populations, are vulnerable to localised depletion due to their life history, or are of low abundance or highly targeted (Harrison 2001).nnIn the Northern Territory and Queensland there are catch limits for recreational fishers of 30 and six fish per person per day, respectively. Since this species is not taken in the Northern Territory and catches are low in Queensland (P. de Lestang, DPIF Northern Territory, pers. comm., J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.), this species is well protected in these two states of Australia.nnIn Western Australia, several small sanctuary (no take) zones, i.e., Surf Point, Mary Anne Island, Gudrun Wreck and Sandy Point, in Shark Bay, are likely to encompass habitats occupied by C. cyanodus (Anonymous 1996, Fairclough in prep.). There are eight no take sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. Spearfishing of tuskfish is prohibited throughout that park (Anonymous 2004b). Proposals are currently being considered for new marine parks on the north-west coast of Western Australia, including the Dampier Archipelago and Montebello Islands, where it is likely that C. cyanodus is found (Penn 2002). Marine Parks in Western Australia do not necessarily imply no take zones, but may include no take zones within their boundaries or restrictions on bag limits or methods used for capture.nnIn Queensland, approximately 5.1 m hectares are declared marine parks and of that 603,000 hectares are fish habitat areas, where fishing is allowed, but the habitat is protected from any development (Anonymous 2000). These areas stretch along the entire Queensland coastline (Anonymous 2000). In the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a proposed rezoning plan will result in ca 33% of the geographical area of the park being designated as no take zones (GBRMPA 2003). It is likely that C. cyanodus occurs in several of these protected areas.nnWhile marine parks have been introduced in areas within the range of C. cyanodus, e.g., Sri Lanka, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, most of these are considered to be ‘paper parks’ and are thus poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced. Only 8% of the 100,000 km² of coral reefs in southeast Asia is included in marine protected areas and only 14% of the 646 MPAs are considered effective, hence the majority of these marine parks probably provide little protection to the species they house (Chou et al. 2002, Licuanan and Gomez 2000).",None

Due to its popularity in the aquarium trade, pressure for collection could represent a local threat to this species in some areas. However, the level of collection for aquarium trade relative to natural abundance is unknown.","There are no species specific conservation measures. However, this species distribution overlaps a number of Marine Protected Areas within its range. In New Caledonia for example, marine reserves are established within the natural range of this species (Wantiez et al. 1997) These reserves cover reef habitat which are suitable to C. fasciatus (Lieske and Myers 1994). Though this species has not been recorded within these reserves, it is very likely that these no-take areas can provide protection to C. fasciatus. About 60 marine parks (with no-fishing areas and buffer zones) are established in Japan including the Okinawa Kaigan Marine Park in Ryukyu where this species may occur (UNEP-WCMC 2008). Tung Sha Tao (Pratas Island), which is now a protected area, may also offer protection to this species though its occurrence in the area needs further survey. C. fasciatus, which may also occur among Western Pacific Islands, may be protected by the newly established Phoenix Island Protected Area in Kiribati, which is currently the largest marine protected area in the world.In Australia, a minimum size of 300 mm TL and a bag limit of six fish apply to all species in this genus (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2008a). There are three, nine-day closure to the taking of all coral reef fishes including Choerodon species in Queensland east coast waters, which are in October, November and December each year around the new moon phase (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2008b). Both recreational and licensed commercial aquarium fish collectors are allowed to operate within certain zones in the Great Barrier Reef (Ryan and Clarke 2005). While SCUBA and hookah are allowed for commercial collectors, recreational collectors can only use mask and snorkel for collecting aquarium fish. There are also gear restrictions (only by hands, small fishing lines or seine-nets) and bag limits (20 fish per person) on aquarium fish collection for both recreational and commercial collectors (Ryan and Clarke 2005).

In Australia, it was observed singly or in small loose aggregations in rubble slopes below drop-offs at depth &gt; 20 m (Kuiter 2006). It preys on mollusks by means of a strong oral jaw (Sale 2002). Juveniles and adults of this species are almost morphologically identical (Kuiter 2006) and is distinguished by the blackish wedge on rear part of body and a pale spot situated below posterior end of dorsal fin base (Allen 2000, Westneat 2001). Coral reef fishes avoid agonistic interaction between conspecific and other species by building up nests (Robertson and Sheldon 1979). Dome-type nest construction with a framework of dead coral skeletons (Takayanagi et al. 2003) by this species was observed on the sandy bottom near Sesoko Island, Japan. It thrusts its head under coral gravels and scrapes out sand to make one or two entrances. Then it lays the dead branching coral skeletons at the entrances. During daytime, it was found that this species patrolled and tidied the nest within its territory (Nanami and Nishihira 1999). At night, the nest was used as a sleeping site for this species. It forms a harem and spawns around sunset (Thresher 1984) but it has been reported that spawning activity of this species does not occur within the nest (Nanami and Nishihira 1999).","There are no major threats known to this species. However, it is collected for the marine aquarium trade and there is no up-to-date information regarding the impacts of aquarium fish collecting on this species. It is also collected for the ornamental trade. In areas such as the Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia, cyanide has reportedly been used for capturing ornamental fishes. It is known that the use of poison to capture fishes can damage the intestinal lining of fishes (Bellwood 1981). This species is one of the smallest Choerodon spp. (Kuiter 2006), it rarely reaches more than the legal capture size of the fishing regulations in the states of Australia, thus, it is generally believed that it is possibly less threatened in Australia under such regulations.","This species distribution includes several Marine Protected Areas within its range. It was found in the Great Barrier Reef (Ryan and Clarke 2005), Ningaloo Reef Marine Park (Colquhoun et al. 2007) and marine park at Fiji (Jennings and Polunin 1997, Brown et al. 2007). However, marine parks do not imply presence of no take zones as limited fishing activity is allowed within certain marine parks. In Gascoyne region of western Australia, Choreodon spp. Is noted as vulnerable to localised depletion. The minimum legal catch size for Choreodon spp. Is 40 cm and daily catch limit is two individuals per angler. No spearfishing is allowed within the Ningaloo Marine Park (Government of Western Australia 2008a). In Queensland, the minimum legal size for tuskfish (Choreodon spp.) is 30 cm and daily bag limit is five in total for all Choreodon species per angler, in addition, closed season for fishing applies to coral reef finfish (Queensland Government). In Pilbara or Kimberley regions, Labridae is considered to have the highest risk of localised depletion (Government of Western Australia 2008). Besides, the minimum legal catch size for Labridae is 40 cm and the daily catch limit is two individuals per species per angler, while the mixed daily bag limit is seven individuals per angler. Currently, management plans are being developed for the new Marine Conservation Parks which including no-take zones (Government of Western Australia 2008). Only licensed fishermen are allowed to capture fishes for aquarium trade in Australia and in Queensland and the total number of fishes harvested for the ornamental fish fishery is approximately 2,108,345 annually (1998-2003) (Ryan and Clarke 2005). Furthermore, the Government of Australia is currently revising the proposal of establishing a 400,000 square mile Coral Sea Heritage Park, where fishing would be banned, in the Great Barrier Reef (Underwater Times 2008).","This species is captured for the aquarium trade in Taiwan (Shao 2008) and Queensland.

Commercial wetline catches, from the main region in which this species is fished, i.e., the Houtman-Abrolhos Islands, a group of islands and reefs ca 70 km offshore at ca 28º45'S, 113º45'E (hereafter referred to as the Abrolhos Islands), remained stable during the 1990s (average ca. 31.5 tons per year)(Crowe et al. 1999). Penn et al. (2003) stated that fishing effort for C. rubescens increased to its highest recorded levels in 2001/02, an increase of 16% from the previous year. However, the catch only increased 2% and thus Penn et al. (2003) suggested that the fishery at the Abrolhos Islands may be showing signs of over-exploitation. Levels of impact on this species are likely to be lower outside of the Abrolhos Islands region, since commercial fishers outside that area target other species primarily (Penn et al. 2003). Total annual commercial catches of C. rubescens using all fishing methods (wetline, gill net, long-line) in Western Australia from 1991/92 to 1997/98 ranged between ca. 40 and 53 t (Crowe et al. 1999).nnThere are no long term data on recreational catches. A survey by Sumner and Williamson (1999) demonstrated that ca. 23 t of C. rubescens were taken in a one year period (September 1996 to August 1997) on the west coast of Australia between Augusta (34º19'S, 115º9'E) and Kalbarri (27º42'S, 114º9'E). A substantial proportion of this came from Jurien Bay (30º18'S, 115º2'E). While more regular monitoring of recreational catches is required in areas where there is higher fishing pressure (Harrison 2001, Sumner et al. 2002), e.g., Jurien Bay and Shark Bay, many areas of the west coast are remote and are less likely to be targeted by recreational fishers.nnNew fishing regulations, which came into effect on the 1st July 2003, reduced the catch limit for recreational fishers to four C. rubescens per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b). Further reductions have been proposed along with an increase in the minimum legal size for capture from 40 cm to 45 cm (Harrison 2001). A closed season has been introduced during the spawning period of C. rubescens, preventing the take of this species in the fish habitat protection area at the Abrolhos Islands (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a). A marine park was declared at Jurien Bay in August 2003 by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management, which contains several no take and restricted activities zones (Anonymous 2003). The above measures will assist in the maintenance of population levels in areas where C. rubescens is more heavily targeted. Furthermore, continued monitoring of catches, examination of the effects of protected areas at the Abrolhos Islands on numbers and size structure of C. rubescens using visual surveys, and enforcement of existing legislation should ensure that any change in stock levels are recognised (Chubb et al. 2002, Pogonoski et al. 2002).nnChoerodon rubescens does not appear to be overexploited currently, based on commercial catch data for the Abrolhos Islands, where the majority of the catch comes from. However, there are several reasons to indicate this species could be vulnerable to overexploitation in the future and as such, should be re-assessed at regular intervals.nn1). The species has a relatively small global distribution.n2). It occurs in coastal waters, and is sought after by recreational fishers for its fighting qualities, size and high quality flesh and it attracts high prices for commercial fishers.n3). It is one of the largest wrasses (reaching 70 cm and 7 kg), it matures on average at approximately 3 years and 29 cm, is long-lived, reaching at least 22 years, and is a protogynous hermaphrodite (Fairclough in prep.).n4). While sex ratios of adult fish are biased towards females, ratios in commercial catches, i.e., of fish above the minimum size limit of 40 cm, are approximately 1:1, suggesting that many males are being removed from the population (at least in the Abrolhos Islands). This may be the cause of a smaller size at sex change in this region, when compared to Shark Bay (further north), since the removal of large males in hermaphroditic species can cause this undesirable effect on sex change, as has been demonstrated for the Venus Tuskfish Choerodon venustus (Platten et al. 2002).n5). Minimum size limits and catch limits regulate the recreational fishery for this species, however, the number of recreational fishers in Western Australia is continually increasing. Furthermore, reports of increased effort by commercial fishers with little increase in catch from the Abrolhos Islands fishery, may imply overexploitation of this species in that region (Penn et al. 2003).nnThis species is classified as Least Concern, since it does not meet the threatened criteria of 'An observed, estimated, inferred, projected or suspected population size reduction of 30% over any 10 year or three generation period, whichever is longer (up to a maximum of 100 years in the future), where the time period must include both the past and the future, and where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible, based on either A1 (c) a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat or A1 (d) actual or potential levels of exploitation' (VU A4c or d). Also, there is some management action in place. However, this species must be monitored and reassessed regularly due to the potential threats of increased fishing effort and the likelihood that this large size species may be particularly susceptible to fishing pressure, especially if target for export.","Choerodon rubescens is found on coastal and offshore reefs on the continental shelf of Western Australia and is suggested to be most abundant at the Abrolhos Islands (ca. 28.5ºS, 113.5ºE), which is approximately in the centre of this species’ distribution (Walker 1983, Hutchins and Swainston 1986, Allen 1999, Hutchins 2001). These islands are situated approximately 70 km offshore from Geraldton, on the west coast of Australia. It is likely to be similarly abundant at sites further north, e.g., along the Zuytdorp Cliffs and the western sides of large islands at the western border of Shark Bay, i.e., Dirk Hartog, Bernier and Dorre Islands (ca. 26ºS, 113.5ºE), although most of these areas are fairly inaccessible, except by boat (Hutchins 1990, Hutchins et al. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). It is also found at Coral Bay at the southern end of Ningaloo Reef (Hutchins and Swainston 1986). Choerodon rubescens is captured by commercial and recreational fishers further south from Geraldton, e.g., Jurien Bay and Perth, where there are more coastal and offshore limestone reefs and islands (Hutchins 1979, Crowe et al. 1999, Sumner and Williamson 1999).","Choerodon rubescens is abundant in the centre of its distribution at the Abrolhos Islands (Walker 1983, Hutchins 2001). Average mean densities in waters close to the islands recorded during visual census work by Nardi (1999) ranged between 3 and 9 fish/250 m². The Abrolhos Islands support the largest commercial fishery for this species, however, commercial fishers tend to fish in deeper waters away from the actual islands (Webster et al. 2002). Wetline catches in this region average 31.5 tons per year and have been consistent for approximately 10 years, however, Penn et al. (2003) suggested that the population at the Abrolhos Islands may be showing signs of over-exploitation, due to increasing fishing effort by wetliners with little increase in total catch.nnHutchins (2001) observed C. rubescens frequently at sites surveyed between Jurien Bay and the northern limit of this species distribution at Coral Bay. But this species was occasionally to rarely observed at sites surveyed to the south of Jurien Bay. Visual census surveys in South Passage, at the southern end of Dirk Hartog Island, Shark Bay (ca. 26ºS, 113.5ºE), and on the east and west coasts of Bernier and Dorre Islands, suggest that C. rubescens is abundant in these areas (Hutchins 1990, Hutchins et al. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). Since much of the coastline within this species distribution consists of limestone reefs, on which C. rubescens is found, the distribution of this species is likely to be fairly continuous at least between Jurien and Coral Bay (Hutchins 2001, Hutchins et al. 1995).",unknown,"Choerodon rubescens is a demersal species found commonly on bare rocky (predominantly limestone) reefs, coral reefs, and rocky reefs with associated coral, algae or seagrass (Hutchins and Swainston 1986, Allen 1999, Fairclough in prep.). It is common in shallow waters (&lt; 20 m) and known to be collected in substantial numbers by commercial fishers in deeper waters (up to 100 m) around the Abrolhos Islands (Fairclough, in prep., S. McCaskie, pers. comm.).nnSmall juveniles (&lt; ca. 150 mm) are common in shallow weedy rock habitats and generally move onto more open habitats after the first 1–2 years of life, where they mature after 3 or more years (Fairclough, in prep.). Choerodon rubescens grows to approximately 70 cm in length and has been aged at up to 22 years (Hutchins and Swainston 1986, Nardi 1999, Fairclough, in prep.). Fish at the minimum legal length for capture of 40 cm range from 4 to 14 years of age (Nardi 1999, Fairclough, in prep.).nnChoerodon rubescens is a protogynous hermaphrodite and is an indeterminate multiple spawner. It spawns between August and January, however, spawning fish are most abundant between September and November, i.e., spring (Nardi 1999, Fairclough, in prep.). Small male gonads indicate that male fish would spawn with only one to a few females at once and Nardi (1999) observed males herding females during the spawning season, suggesting that they maintain harems at this time. Sex ratios of adult fish, i.e., above the size at which 50% of females reach sexual maturity (ca. 290 mm), are biased towards females, i.e., ca. 10 females :1 male (Fairclough, in prep.). Nardi (1999) suggests that C. rubescens aggregates to spawn in shallow waters at the Abrolhos Islands, due to increased counts of this species during visual surveys during its spawning season.nnCurrent research in Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands demonstrates that the size at sexual maturity of females is similar in both regions, but fish are older at this size in the Abrolhos Islands, related to slower growth in this region (Fairclough, in prep.). The sizes at which 50% of individuals change sex in Shark Bay and the Abrolhos Islands are substantially different and may be related to the differences in growth at different latitudes and/or fishing pressure influencing the social structure (Fairclough, in prep.). The ratio of females to males of C. rubescens in commercial catches from the Abrolhos Islands is approximately 1:1. The high fishing pressure and consistent capture of larger, often male, Venus Tuskfish Choerodon venustus, at some locations in Queensland resulted in a decrease in the size at sex change for this species at those sites (Platten et all. 2002).","An increase in commercial and/or recreational fishing pressure is the main threat to this species, with the largest catches coming from around the Abrolhos Islands, and other areas of importance being Jurien Bay and Shark Bay (Sumner and Williamson 1999, Penn et al. 2003, Sumner et al. 2002). Although commercial wetline catches have remained consistent during the 1990s in the Abrolhos Islands, where 50% of the commercial wetline catch is derived from (Crowe et al. 1999), a 16% increase in effort in 2001/02 compared to the previous year, but with little increase in catches (2%), suggested that stocks in that region were showing signs of over-explotation (Penn et al. 2003). The lower length at which 50% of females change sex in the Abrolhos Islands (479 mm) versus Shark Bay (545 mm), may indicate that fishing pressure is having an impact on social structure in the former region, as was demonstrated for Choerodon venustus in Queensland (Platten et al. 2002). High fishing pressure resulted in a decrease in the length at sex change for the latter species. In the Abrolhos Islands, ratios of females to males in catches of fish that were above the length at 50% sexual maturity and were caught by recreational rod and line fishing are approximately 10:1, whilst for fish collected by commercial fishers, the sex ratios are close to 1:1 (Fairclough in prep.). This implies that there are greater numbers of females in the adult population, as is common for protogynous hermaphrodites, but that commercial fishers are taking approximately equal numbers of females and males. If the minimum legal size limit is increased to 45 cm, the proportion of males in commercial catches may increase. This may have an undesirable impact on the size at sex change in the Abrolhos Islands, as occurred for C. venustus and may eventually have an impact on assemblages elsewhere on the west coast of Australia, if fishing pressure is high enough. The Abrolhos Islands represents a unique environment, being the southernmost coral reefs in the Indian Ocean and containing 211 species of hermatypic and ahermatypic corals (Hatcher 1991, Nardi 1998). Anthropogenic threats to habitats at the Abrolhos Islands, such as coral areas, that are occupied by C. rubescens, are well documented, and include activities such as diving and recreational boating. These impacts are considered to be minimal (Webster et al. 2002). However, they do require further quantification and the development of suitable management plans (Webster et al. 2002).","The minimum legal size limit for retention (commercial and recreational) of C. rubescens in Western Australia is 40 cm, which is above the length at sexual maturity of ca. 290 mm (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b; Fairclough, in prep.). Catch limits of four fish per person per day for recreational fishers came into effect on 1st July 2003, however there have been recommendations that this be further reduced to two and the minimum size limit be increased to 45 cm (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b; Harrison 2001). These limits are based on the type of life history that a particular species has. Thus, tuskfish are included in the category of 'highest risk' (Harrison 2001). Species in this category are generalized as having the following characteristics: they are long-lived, slow-growing, they mature at four years plus, form semi-resident populations, are vulnerable to localised depletion due to their life history, or are of low abundance or highly targeted (Harrison 2001).nnSanctuary zones at the Abrolhos Islands include four no take 'Reef Observation Areas' (ROA), which were introduced in the mid-1990s (Nardi 1998). These ROAs have apparently had little impact on the size or abundance of C. rubescens (K. Nardi, Department of Fisheries, Western Australia, pers. comm.). Monitoring of future catches and the impact of protected areas on fish numbers has been highlighted as a priority for research (Webster et al. 2002). A closed fishing season for C. rubescens was introduced for the 'Fish Habitat Protection Area', that surrounds the Abrolhos Islands, from 1 November to 31 January, which encompasses a substantial proportion of the spawning period of theis species (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a).nnThere is a no take sanctuary zone in South Passage (southern end of Dirk Hartog Island), Shark Bay, and eight no take sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park (Anonymous 1996, Anonymous 2004a). Spearfishing of tuskfish is prohibited throughout the Ningaloo marine park (Anonymous 2004a). A no take sanctuary zone was also introduced at Mary Anne Island in the western gulf of Shark Bay for C. rubescens, however this may be due to a misidentification of the Choerodon species, since C. rubescens does not occur within the more southern regions of the gulfs of Shark Bay (Anonymous 1996, Fairclough in prep.). Choerodon rubescens is found only occasionally at Rottnest Island, near Perth (Hutchins 1979, 2001). Spearfishing is prohibited within 200 metres from shore and netting is prohibited within 500 metres from shore around Rottnest Island (Anonymous 2004b).nnA marine park was declared at Jurien Bay in August 2003, which contains several no take sanctuary zones and areas which restrict commercial or recreational fishing activities, and in which C. rubescens is likely to occur (Anonymous 2003).",None

(Grouper & Wrasse Red List Authority)",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None,124,44669,None,"Choerodon schoenleinii is a highly sought after food fish throughout its distribution. It is high on the list of regularly caught species by recreational fishers at surveyed locations in Western Australia and is a prized species in many areas of south-east Asia, including Sabah, Japan and Hong Kong. There has been a severe decline in its abundance in Hong Kong since the 1940s and it is now considered rare in that location (A. Cornish, pers. comm.; Cornish 2003). Choerodon schoenleinii is a large species, reaching up to 100 cm, and it is a monandric protogynous hermaphrodite, with very low numbers of males recorded in Shark Bay, Western Australia (Ebisawa et al. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). Those two studies demonstrated that male fish occur only in the largest size classes, i.e., &gt; ca. 50 cm, and these are commonly the target of fishers, e.g., in Hong Kong (Cornish 2003). Heavy fishing pressure for local and live reef fish trade use would have rapidly reduced the numbers of males in assemblages of this species and would have undoubtedly contributed to its rapid decline in locations such as Hong Kong. It is also considered to be overexploited in Japan (Ebisawa et al. 1995).nnThus, heavy fishing pressure coupled with the large scale use of destructive fishing practices in south-east Asia and overall low abundances in that region (Werner and Allen 2000, Allen and McKenna 2001) put this species at risk in a substantial proportion of its range. Choerodon schoenleinii should be considered to be Near Threatened and it almost meets the criteria for Vulnerable: VU A2cd and/or VU A3cd and/or VU A4cd. This species should be monitored regularly for further evidence of population decline/ or fragmentation and every effort made to obtain information on its fishery, especially in southeastern Asia and Japan.nn Regional status: nn Australia nChoerodon schoenleinii is widely distributed and is probably not threatened in many areas of Australia due to the remoteness of its northern coastline, where this species occurs. However, individual assemblages in some areas where there is heavy recreational or commercial fishing pressure may be under threat of localised depletions, e.g., Shark Bay, Dampier and Broome in Western Australia and parts of the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland.nnSE Asiann Hong Kong nChoerodon schoenleinii fetches the highest prices for any live reef fish caught in Hong Kong. The species is now extremely rare in Hong Kong, e.g., three seen in roughly 750 dives throughout Hong Kong waters since 1995, (Cornish, pers. comm. 2004) and while it has long been commercially extinct, it was abundant enough in the 1940s to support a small dedicated fishery using longlines with sea-urchins as bait (Cornish 2003).nn Malaysia n'Usually dwells in the vicinity of coral reefs, common length 28.6 cm. Not a commercial fish as it does not have a good reputation as a food fish in Peninsular Malaysia. Highly priced in Sabah. Some people like the larger fishes which are highly esteemed in Hong Kong' (Mohsin and Ambak 1996).nn Other nChoerodon schoenleinii is most likely to be threatened in areas of south-east Asia, e.g., the Ryukyu Islands (Ebisawa et al. 1995), the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, since C. schoenleinii is a commercial target in many of these areas and methods such as explosives, poisoning, spearfishing and night-time fisheries, are commonly used to capture fish. Many of these countries have used these methods for a long period of time and thus not only localised population declines are likely, but also the destruction of important habitats on a broader scale (TRACC 2004). It is valued eating fish and one of the best among the wrasses for its flesh (A. Nakazono, pers. comm.).nn The Live Reef Food Fish Trade nAlthough not among the 13 most common species in the trade which sources reef fishes from the Indo-Pacific for export primarily to Hong Kong (China), this species is nonetheless included in the lucrative and large international live fish trade (Lee and Sadovy 1998, Sadovy et al. 2003). Although import quantities are not available for this species alone, except for the occasional record (e.g., at least 60.5 kg was brought into Hong Kong in May 2000 by live fish vessel: Clarus Chu, pers. comm.), substantial numbers of C. schoenleinii are included in the trade at sizes generally of 25–40 cm, probably less than that at which sexual maturity is attained (A. Cornish, pers. comm. 2004).","Choerodon schoenleinii occurs as far south on the Western Australian coast as the Houtman-Abrolhos Islands (a group of islands and reefs ca. 70 km offshore at ca 28°45'S, 113°45'E), however, it is considered to be rare at this location (Hutchins 2001). Choerodon schoenleinii was not recorded on inshore coastal reefs south of Shark Bay (ca. 26°S, 113.5°E) during the surveys of Hutchins (2001). Surveys by Hutchins (2001, 2003) and Newman et al. (2003) demonstrate that C. schoenleinii occurs along the northern Pilbara/Kimberley coastline of Western Australia as far north as Wyndham (15°29'S, 128°7'E), but not on the offshore atolls along this coast, i.e., Rowley Shoals, Scott Reef and Ashmore reef. Choerodon schoenleinii is a target for commercial fishers, fishing tour operators and recreational fishers in Darwin, Northern Territory, and is thus probably widespread in this region (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.). It is taken by recreational and commercial fishers along the Queensland coastline, in particular the Great Barrier Reef, where this species is widely distributed (Grant 1993; J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Choerodon schoenleinii is likely to occur throughout south-east Asia, such as the Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands, where it is a commercial target (Westneat 2004, Ebisawaiet al. 1995). It is probably equally well distributed throughout the rest of its range, e.g., along the Viet Nam and Thailand coastlines, around Malaysia, Indonesia, Irian Jaya, Papua New Guinea and south to Vanuatu, where it is also reported to occur (Eli 2002, Allen and Adrim 2003). Many of these areas provide suitable habitats for this species. A report of C. schoenleinii occurring in Mauritius must be treated with some caution, since there is no evidence of it occurring between Mauritius and south-east Asia (Eli 2002).","Australia nChoerodon schoenleinii is abundant in many areas of Shark Bay, Western Australia (Fairclough in prep.), and Hutchins (2001) demonstrated that densities ranged from occasional to abundant at locations northwards from Ningaloo reef to Wyndham (15º29'S, 128º7'E). This species is probably equally abundant along the coastlines of the Northern Territory and Queensland, Australia, since this species is distributed across the whole of the northern half of Australia and commercial and recreational catches of C. schoenleinii in the Northern Territory and Queensland are low to moderate (Penn 2002; P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm.; J. Platten, EPA Queensland, pers. comm.). Its distribution along the western and eastern coastlines of Australia is likely to be fairly continuous within its range, due to similar habitat being available throughout (Hutchins 2001, Grant, 1993). However, the degree of fragmentation of its distribution and levels of abundance in the Northern Territory of Australia are unclear.nn SE Asia nThroughout south-east Asia, the distribution of C. schoenleinii is probably widespread, since coastal reef habitats are virtually ubiquitous in this region. For example, it was reported to occur from Papua to Sumatra in Indonesia by Allen and Adrim (2003). However, it is rarely reported as being common, e.g., C. schoenleinii was reported to be rare with only sub-adults seen during a rapid biodiversity assessment of the Calamianes Islands (Palawan Province, Philippines) (Werner and Allen 2000) and was not seen at all during similar surveys of the coral reefs of Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea (Werner and Allen 1998), the Raja Ampat Islands, West Papua, Indonesia (McKenna et. al. 2002), or the Togean and Banggai Islands, Sulawesi, Indonesia (Allen and McKenna 2001). This may be due to fragmentation of the populations of C. schoenleinii caused by naturally low abundances and/or localised stock depletions due to fishing pressure and destruction of habitat. The latter may be fairly widespread. For example, in Sabah, Borneo, and Indonesia, fishing pressure is concentrated in the inshore region of the coastline and destructive collection methods have depleted most of the inshore fish stocks (TRACC 2004). Destruction of coral reef habitat is also likely to be a contributing factor (see Threats).nnIn Okinawa, Japan, and Hong Kong C. schoenleinii is/was a very important commercial species and is suggested to be overexploited (Ebisawa et. al. 1995, Cornish 2003).",unknown,"Choerodon schoenleinii is a demersal species and is abundant in shallow water reefs in waters of north-western Australia and along the Queensland coast (&lt; 20 m) (Allen 1999, Hutchins 2001, Grant 1993, Randall et. al. 1997, Fairclough, in prep). It is, however, reported to occur in waters up to 60 m deep (Westneat 2004). It is found on sand and weed areas adjacent to coral reefs (Grant 1993, Randall et. al. 1997, Allen 1999). In Shark Bay, Western Australia, it is found on rocky limestone reefs, weedy rock areas, rocky shorelines and seagrass areas (Travers and Potter 2002, Fairclough in prep.). In particular, limestone and coral patch reefs are important for adults of this species in Shark Bay (Fairclough, in prep.). Juveniles (&lt; ca. 150 mm) are found in weedy rock or seagrass habitats, but fish above this size are more common on open reefs in Shark Bay, for example (Travers and Potter 2002, Fairclough, in prep.). Kanashiro (1998) demonstrated that seagrass beds were important for this species during the first few months of life with the presence of larvae and small juveniles in these habitats at Yagachi Island, Japan.nnChoerodon schoenleinii reaches lengths of up to 100 cm and ca. 16 kg in weight (Grant 1993). It is a protogynous hermaphrodite and is an indeterminate multiple spawner (Ebisawa et. al. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). Fifty percent of females mature at ca. 25 cm and it spawns mainly in spring in both Shark Bay, Western Australia, and at Okinawa Island, Japan (Ebisawa et. al. 1995, Fairclough, in prep.). Histology demonstrated that this species is monandric and that relatively small testes indicate that male fish would spawn with only one to a few females at once (Ebisawa et. al. 1995, Fairclough in prep). Males only occur in the upper size classes (&gt; ca. 50 cm) and low numbers of males recorded in the population in Shark Bay and at Okinawa Island, Japan, also suggest that this species would be haremic (Ebisawa et. al. 1995, Fairclough, in prep.). Since catch rates derived from line fishing or densities derived from visual surveys in Shark Bay demonstrated little variation during the different months of the year (Fairclough, in prep.), it is unlikely that this species forms large spawning aggregations.","A minimum legal size of 40 cm and a catch limit of four tuskfish per person per day in the west coast and Gascoyne regions of Western Australia limits the capture of C. schoenlenii in those two regions (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b). However, the minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm has not been set based on any knowledge of the biology of this species, since there is currently no information published on Western Australian stocks. In the northern Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A. the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003c). These catch limit regulations for the Pilbara/Kimberley region are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west coast and Gascoyne regions of W.A. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, for example, only a relatively few fish &gt; 40 cm, the minimum legal length for retention, are captured by line fishing, thus reducing the impact of fishing on this species in that embayment (Fairclough in prep.). Records of catches of recreational fishers in Western Australia indicate that C. schoenleinii is regularly one of the top ten species caught from areas of the northern Pilbara/Kimberley region of Western Australia, e.g., Dampier and Broome (Newman et. al. 2003). Thus, there may be the potential for localised depletions of this species in areas of Western Australia, where commercial and/or recreational fishing pressure is high. Catches of the combined tuskfish and parrotfish category in the Northern Territory and Queensland are low, hence it is unlikely to be under widespread threat in these regions (P. de Lestang, Northern Territory Government, pers. comm., J. Platten, DPIF Queensland, pers. comm.). However, it is specifically targeted by recreational fishers in Moreton Bay, Queensland, which may have a localised impact on this species’ abundance (Grant 1993). There is little specific information on the level of exploitation of this species throughout south-east Asia. However, Ebisawa et. al. (1995) states that C. schoenleinii is an important commercial species in Okinawa, Japan, and that it is overexploited. The majority of C. schoenleinii caught in this region range in length from 20 to 35 cm and thus, based on studies of the reproductive biology of this species, many captured fish are likely to be sexually immature (Ebisawa et. al. 1995, Fairclough in prep.). Destructive fishing practices, e.g., explosives, spearfishing, poisoning and night-time fishing, used in many parts of south-east Asia to capture fish for local consumption, the live reef fish trade and the aquarium trade, are likely to cause, or may already have caused, declines in stocks of C. schoenleinii in these areas (Munday and Allen 2000, Chou et. al. 2002, Wabnitz et. al. 2003, TRACC 2004). However, there is little data to suggest how much C. schoenleinii contributes to these fisheries. Furthermore, any continued destruction of habitats will lead to further fragmentation of stocks and ultimately to their decline. Land clearing, and thus sedimentation from increased run-off, and poor sanitation in south-east Asian countries, such as Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, also have the potential to destroy important nearshore habitats (Munday and Allen 2000, Chou et. al. 2002). In south-east Asia, it has been estimated that 56 % of all coral reefs are at high risk, and 26% are of medium risk from human disturbance (Bryant et. al. 1998).","A minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm and a catch limit of four tuskfish per person per day in the west coast and Gascoyne regions of Western Australia limits the capture of C. schoenlenii in those two regions (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003a, b). However, the minimum legal length (MLL) of 40 cm has not been set based on any knowledge of the biology of this species, since there is currently no information published on Western Australian stocks. In the northern Pilbara/Kimberley region of W.A. the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day (Department of Fisheries Western Australia 2003c). These catch limit regulations for the Pilbara/Kimberley region are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west coast and Gascoyne regions of W.A. Although, in the future, the MLL may change in all regions of WA where C. schoenleinii occurs, to reflect increased knowledge of the biology of this species (Fairclough in prep.), the catch limit is unlikely to change from four fish per person per day, unless it is reduced further. These limits are based on the type of life history that a particular species has. Thus, tuskfish are included in the category of 'highest risk' (Harrison 2001). Species in this category are generalised as having the following characteristics: they are long-lived, slow-growing, they mature at four years plus, form semi-resident populations, are vulnerable to localised depletion due to their life history, or are of low abundance or highly targeted (Harrison 2001). There is also a MLL of 30 cm in Queensland and a catch limit of six tuskfish per person per day. However, in the Northern Territory, while there is a catch limit for recreational fishers, there is no MLL. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, several small sanctuary (no take) zones, i.e., Surf Point, Mary Anne Island, Gudrun Wreck and Sandy Point, are likely to encompass habitats occupied by C. schoenleinii (Anonymous 1996, Fairclough in prep.). There are eight no take sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. Spearfishing of tuskfish is prohibited throughout the marine park (Anonymous 2004). Proposals are currently being considered for new marine parks on the north-west coast of Western Australia (Penn 2002), including the Dampier Archipelago and the Montebello Islands, where C. schoenleinii was recorded frequently during surveys by Hutchins (2001). Marine Parks in Western Australia do not necessarily imply no-take zones, but may include no take zones within their boundaries or restrictions on catch limits or methods used for capture. In Queensland, there is a minimum legal length for retention of 30 cm and a catch limit of six fish per person per day (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2003). Approximately 5.1 million hectares of Queensland marine waters are declared marine parks and, of this, 603,000 hectares are fish habitat areas, where fishing is allowed, but the habitat is protected from development (Anonymous 2000). These areas stretch along the entire Queensland coastline (Anonymous 2000). It is likely that C. schoenleinii occurs in at least several of these protected areas. In the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, a proposed rezoning plan will result in ca 33% of the geographical area of the park being designated as no take zones (GBRMPA 2003). It is likely that C. schoenleinii occurs in several of these protected areas. While many marine parks have been introduced in areas within the range of C. schoenleinii, e.g., Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Philippines, most of these are considered to be ‘paper parks’ and are poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced. Only 8% of the 100,000 km² of coral reefs in southeast Asia is included in marine protected areas and only 14% of the 646 MPAs are considered effective, hence the majority of these MPAs probably provide little protection to the species they house (Licuanan and Gomez 2000, Chou et al. 2002). Local fishermen in Okinawa started a regulation not to catch this species smaller than 1 kg (<a href='http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/eco/20030328_4.html'>A. Nakazono, pers. comm.</a>).",None

In the last 10 years the global landings of this species have been as follows: 1997 - 150, 027 tonnes, 1998 - 145, 747 tonnes, 1999 - 162, 437 tonnes, 2000 - 182, 499 tonnes, 2001 - 171, 701 tonnes, 2002 - 195, 422 tonnes, 2003 - 179, 011 tonnes, 2004 - 168, 625 tonnes, 2005 - 167, 975 tonnes, 2006 - 175, 770 tonnes, 2007 - 164, 016 tonnes (FAO-FIGIS 2008). There is no apparent increase or decrease in the population as the landings of this species have fluctuated since the 1950s. This species is marketed fresh or may be dried or salted; also sold frozen and canned.The stocks of Decapterus russelli are subject to heavy exploitation (Perrin and Borsa 2001) and are reported to be overexploited (Mansor and Abdullah 1995; Atmaja and Nugroho 2005). On the Sunda shelf (extension of the continental shelf of South East Asia) the annual landings of scads have decreased from around 82,500t in 1994 to around 42,500t in 2004 (51.5% decrease), despite an increase in fishery effort of around 50% for the same period (Atmaja and Nugroho 2005). This reported decline is only known from a small part of this species range. In general the global landings of this species appear to relatively steady, however this could be better supported by further information on the fishing effort in this time.","There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for Indian Mackeral Scad. However, the distribution of this species may fall within numerous designated marine protected areas.Monitoring of the population numbers and harvest levels of this species is needed, along with further research on the fishing effort in all the major fishery regions.","The Indian Mackeral Scad, Decapterus russelli, is a highly commercial species and is taken in coastal waters throughout its range."

In the Indo-Pacific it is known along East Africa, the Red Sea, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands. In the eastern Pacific it is known from the southern Gulf of California, Mexico to Ecuador including the offshore islands. There are no confirmed records from the Persian Gulf (W.

In the western Atlantic it is known from Massachusetts south along the U.S., Bermuda, the Bahamas, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and along South America to Sao Paulo, Brazil including Trinidade Island (Smith-Vaniz 2002, Simon et al. 2013). In the eastern Atlantic it has been recorded from the Azores, Canary Islands (very rare), Cape Verde Islands, Ascension and St. Helena Islands, and perhaps from Senegal (Sagna pers. comm. 2013) to Angola (Friedlander et al. 2014, Smith-Vaniz FAO ECA Guide in prep). The depth range for this species is 1-150 m (Lieske and Myers 1994).","This species is common and locally abundant in some parts of its range, such as Ghana and Cape Verde.It was one of the most ubiquitous species observed associated with drifting fish aggregating devices in the Western Indian Ocean andwas a significant component of the bycatch in tuna purse seines (Taquetet al.2007). In the western Atlantic, it was the second most commonly captured carangid of the five species studied (Aprieto 1974). Large schools of this species have been reported from Navidad and Silver Banks, Caribbean; continental shelf off Nicaragua, Caribbean, Atol das Rocas, Ilha de Fernando de Noronha, Brazil; Rocas de Sao Pedro e Sao Paulo, western tropical Atlantic; continental shelf off Panama (Tropical Eastern Pacific); Clipperton Island; Gulf of Aden and Daimaniyat Islands, Oman (Yesaki 1979).Based on the CECAF south working (2009) which covers Guinea Bissau to Angola, landings for Carangidae spp. from 1994-2008 show an increase up to 20,000 in 2001 and are stable until 2008, when they drop to 12,000 metric tons, but not all countries are reporting (CECAF 2009). FAO landings for Carangids nei peaked between 1970 to 1980, averaging around 24,000 metric tonnes per year, and then fell in 1980to an average of 18,000 metric tonnes per year, fluctuating between 16,000 and 18,000 per year, and remained relatively stable since.",stable,"Elagatis bipinnulata is a pelagic species, found mainly near the surface, over reefs and sometimes offshore (Berry 1969). It may form large schools and prey items include invertebrates and fish. The maximum size is 107 cm fork length (FL), but is common to 80 cm FL (Smith-Vaniz 2002). The all-tackle IGFA world angling record is 17.05 kg (Smith-Vaniz FAO ECA Guide in prep). Its depth range is 1-150 m (Lieske and Myers 1994).Spawning is thought to occur throughout the year in the Indo-Pacific and Western Atlantic, with a peak in larval/juvenile capture in March in the Indo-Pacific and in every month except May and December in the Western Atlantic (Okiyama 1970, Aprieto 1974, Yesaki 1979). It exhibits pair courtship in Belize, in schools of up to ~300 fish (Graham and Castellanos 2005). In Sao Pedro and Sao Paulo Archipelago, length at first sexual maturity for females was estimated at 64.6 cm FL. Spawning period in the area occurs during the first semester of the year (Pinheiro et al. 2011).","Some populations may be locally impacted due to excessive bycatch in the tuna purse seine fishery. In the tuna fishery in the Eastern Indian Ocean, it was a major component of the bycatch (6% of the total catch from October 1993 to February 2005). Aggregating behaviour around fish aggregating devices (FADs) may render them vulnerable to overfishing. However, there are no indications at present time of regional or global declines from harvesting.In the Gulf of Mexico off Mexico, it is taken as bycatch in fisheries targetingsardines(SAGARPA 2012).",There are no species-specific conservation measures in place.There are no fishery regulations for this species in U.S. waters.,"Elagatis bipinnulatais harvested for food and is a popular game fish; caught mainly with hook and line, gillnets and seines; marketed fresh and dried salted(Smith-Vaniz 1984).There are no existing large-scale fisheries; it is generally caught incidentally by artisanal or recreational fishermen (Yesaki 1979).Itis targeted for food in the Philippines (Maypaet al. 2002) and Colombia (Olarte and Gonzalez 2004). It is also caught as bycatch in the tuna purse seine fishery.

This species was suspected to be a protogynous hermaphrodite (Carlson et al. 2008).Epibulus insidiator male colour was observed to intensify during courtship (Colin and Bell 1991). Males swam with caudal fin collapsed and tilted up and the anal fin folded and extended down. Males can revert to normal colour pattern when disturbed. The territory sizes of males were approximately 500-1,000 m<sup>2</sup> and females seemed to have home ranges within this territory. Spawning occurred after or near high tide. It is sexually dimorphic with the size of male larger than the female. This species spawned in harem with males patrolling territory. Spawning ascent distance was about two to three m. Females were reported to lead the spawning. Spawning activities were found in March, April, May, July, September and October. The shape of the eggs is almost spherical.","There are no major threats known for this species, although it is collected for food fish fisheries, and was reported in the Hong Kong fish market (Situ andSadovy 2004). This species is also collected for the aquarium trade and such trade may have significant effect on fish natural population (Tissot and Hallacher 2003), however the level of use in ornamental fish or food trade is unknown.","There are no species-specific conservation measures for this species. However, this species distribution includes a number of Marine Protected Areas within its range. More species-specific information on harvest and trade for is needed for this species.In MadagascarThis species was reported from the Natural Reserve of the Glorieuses Islands (Durville et al. 2003). Labrids are not major catches in the reef fishes surrounding the south-west Madagascar in 1997 (Laroche et al. 1997), and catch-per-unit-effort is still relatively high in these fishing grounds. There are two marine protected areas, with no-take zones, located in the northwest region of Madagascar (McKenna and Allen 2005). This species was commonly sighted during a rapid biodiversity survey in northwest Madagascar, and is likely protected within the protected areas (McKenna and Allen 2005).In MozambiqueThere is no known fishery management or regulations on this species in Mozambique. There is a 22 km<sup>2</sup> marine reserve, two national parks and one wildlife sanctuary where coastal waters are protected (Francis et al. 2002, Wells et al. 2007). A fish survey in 2000 at various locations including marine protected areas did not record this species (Motta et al. 2002). The occurrence of this species within these areas needs further investigation. In AustraliaQueenslandMarine parks are established within Queensland including the well-know Great Barrier Reef. Marine parks are zoned for different purposes and offer different levels of protection from recreational and commercial fishing activities (Environmental Protection Agency 2008). For fishery management, a minimum size of 25 cm TL and a bag limit of 5 fish apply to all wrasses (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2008a). There are three, nine-day closure to the taking of all coral reef fishes in Queensland east coast waters, which are in October, November and December each year around the new moon phase (Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries 2008b). There is no specific management measure or regulation on this species in commercial food fish fishery. This species is collected as part of the international aquarium fish trade. Both recreational and licensed commercial aquarium fish collectors are allowed to operate within certain zones in the Great Barrier Reef (Ryan and Clarke 2005). While SCUBA and hookah are allowed for commercial collectors, recreational collectors can only use mask and snorkel for collecting aquarium fish. There are also gear restrictions (only by hands, small fishing lines or seine-nets) and bag limits (20 fish per person) on aquarium fish collection for both recreational and commercial collectors (Ryan and Clarke 2005). There is no specific management or regulation on E. insidiator.",This species is collected for food and for the aquarium trade.

It has also been recorded from Tonga (Randall et al. 2003). It is apparently absent from Micronesia, Polynesia and most islands of the western Indian Ocean (Randall and Heemstra 1991).

Population data are limited in many parts of its range. It is likely declining where trawl fisheries are highly active.  Hong Kong: In the 1960s, the common size of this species in the Hong Kong market was about 35 cm total length (Chan 1968). In the Port Survey conducted by the AFCD with fishermen in 1996/1997, the estimated annual catch of this speciesby weight was 1 metric ton in Hong Kong waters (AFCD 1998). This species was considered commonly taken in the past, but has become rarer over time (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). A Hong Kong market survey conducted from 2004 to 2006 recorded 13 wild caught individuals of this species, 52% of which were immature and it ranked 13<sup>th</sup>by number amongst other grouper species (To 2009, To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). The size of fish declined by 19 to 41% over about 40 years, which may indicate overfishing. A survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Hong Kong restaurants and wet markets recorded 99 individuals of this species, which represented about 0.4% of all groupers surveyed (including farmed and wild caught individuals) in terms of number, and 63% were found to be immature (Lam 2013). There is no long-term species-specific landings data for this species in Hong Kong. An underwater survey conducted in coral areas and rocky reefs and adjacent areas in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2016 recorded this species only once (n=187 surveys; Shea and Ho 2016). However, this species occurs in areas that were not sufficiently surveyed such as silty sand bottoms in deeper waters, and its absence in shallow reef surveys should be interpreted with caution. Japan: Landings of this species in theYaeyama Islands of Japan was 280, 53 and 56 kg respectively for 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the number of individuals landed during these years were 624, 135 and 103 (Ohta 2008). The stock of this species is very likely to be declining (K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016). From 2008 to 2013, landings of this species at Fukue Fish Market, Goto Island increased from about 500 kg in 2008, peaked at 2,000 kg in 2011 and then was stable from 1,300 – 1,400 kg in 2012 and 2013 (Nakagawa 2014). The average weight of individuals of this species landed at the Goto Island port was around 1 kg per fish from 2008 to 2010, then weight per fish slightly increased in 2011 and 2012. During this time period, local fishing effort and number of fishermen did not increase (Nakagawa 2014, K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016). There is a lack of long-term species-specific landings data for this species in Japan.    Persian Gulf, Abu Dhabi and Oman: Aggregate FAO RECOFI landings of this speciesin the Persian Gulf increased from 306 in 2000 to 473 tonnes in 2011. Itwas consistently recorded in the Abu Dhabi fishery from 2001-2012. In 2005, it was separated from the aggregated serranid landings (1.2 mt in the fishery). Landingsdeclined from 1.2 tonnes in 2005 to 0.4 tonnes in 2012, which represents about a 67% decline over eight years. This species has typicallybeen only a very minor component of the serranid catch in the UAE. It is occasionally found in markets (i.e., not directly targeted) elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. This species may be extensively fished in Oman and the Arabian Sea by the line fishery and trawling, and there are concerns for impacts on the population from high fishing pressure (J. McIlwain unpublished data).  India: Fisheries surveys conducted from 2010 to 2011 in Kerala, India reported that this was an ‘abundant’ species captured in the seamount fishery off the west coast, and the size range of the fish was 22 to 32 cm (Bineesh et al. 2014). A survey conducted from 2009 - 2011 in fish landing centres of Visakhapatnam reported that the common size of this species in the commercial catches was 19 to 21 cm total length (n = 81) (Kandula et al. 2015).  Indonesia: This species is caught in the deep water demersal multi-species fisheries in eastern Indonesia, and from 2014 to 2016 at least 90% of the individuals (n = 13,112) were mature. This fishery does not target immature size classes of this species (Mous and Pet 2016). Mega-spawners accounted for about 9% of the catch by number for this species. Although this fishery is not known to be causing overfishing of this species, there is substantial risk for overfishing due to the unsustainable harvest of mega spawners (Mous and Pet 2016). In Buton (eastern Indonesia), underwater surveys conducted in 2006 and 2007 recorded 4 and 8 individuals of this species per hectare, respectively. In Kalmas in 2010, the density of this species was 2 fish per hectare and in Sibolga (western Indonesia) surveys reported 4.4 fish per hectare in 2008 (S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016). It was not recorded in other surveys conducted from 2004 to 2013 in many other localities, but this may be due to the lack of survey effort in deeper and silty sand bottoms.  East Africa: A market survey conducted in 2007 at three beaches in southern Kenya where there is high artisanal fishing effort reported that this species comprised less than 1% of all grouper catches (in terms of number of fish) (Agembe et al. 2010). This species represents 0.5 to 1% of the total catch in the small-scale industrial and commercial line and trap fisheries of Mozambique (Maputo unpublished data). This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> most commonly landed serranid in commercial fisheries of Djibouti (Darar 1994). Underwater surveys conducted from 2010 to 2015 at 52 sites across Tanzania, Mozambique and Djibouti recorded only a single sighting of this species (M. Samoilys unpublished data 2016).  Maldives: The grouper fishery in the Maldives in 2010 reported a shift in size distribution for some of the most commonly exploited species to smaller size classes, and a significant decrease in mean lengths for the most common species in comparison to a similar study conducted around the year 2005 (Sattar and Adams 2005, Sattar et al. 2011). Many landed grouper individuals in the Maldives fishery are immature (Sattar et al. 2011) and the length of this species in the export trade during 2003 to 2004 was about 31.8 cm total length (n=23; Sattar and Adams 2005).  Australia: This species is captured in the commercial Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery of Western Australia where it represents about 7% of total finfish catch (in terms of number of fish) and a wide size range of this species was recorded (Newman et al. 2001). About 220 – 240 kg of this species were landed in 2014 and 2015 in the commercial Queensland line fishery (State of Queensland 2013). Reef Life Survey data from 2010 to 2015 yielded only a single record of this species from Australia (Edgar and Stuart-Smith 2014). It was not recorded during underwater surveys conducted in the Great Barrier Reef (Pears 2005). Solomon Islands: During a survey conducted in the Solomon Islands Honiara fish market in 2015 and 2016, this species comprised about 5% of all groupers in terms of number of fish and about 98% of these individuals were mature (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources).  New Caledonia: This is one of the most common grouper species caught by fisheries on soft bottoms in New Caledonia (8% of grouper catch). It is not frequently captured in the handline fishery, but is a major component of serranid longline catch in New Caledonia (Kulbicki et al. 2000).  Taiwan: During 10-15 years of underwater observation in a very limited locality in Taiwan, this species was regarded as “occasional” (K-T. Shao pers. comm. 2016).  Pacific oceanic islands: Underwater surveys conducted across 17 Pacific Island countries from 2002 to 2009 rarely recorded this species, and where it was sighted, usually only a single fish was recorded (Pacific Regional Oceanic and Coastal Fisheries Development Programme 2002-2009), but since this species also inhabits non-reef area, these low sightings should be interpreted with caution.",unknown,"This continental shelfspecies is usually found in turbid water in seagrass beds or silty sand bottoms around isolated small rock outcrops, as well as near dead coral or soft coral as deep as 200 metres (Randall and Ben-Tuvia 1983, Leis 1987, Randall and Heemstra 1991). Juveniles are common to depths of 80 m (Kailola et al. 1993). It has also been observed on artificial reefs in Hong Kong (AFCD 2001). It feeds on fish and benthic invertebrates, primarily prawns and crabs (Parrish 1987, Randall and Heemstra 1991, Salini et al. 1994, Kulbickiet al.2005). Maximum total length is 47 cm and maximum weight is 1.4 kg (Moran et al. 1988). The maximum reported age for this species is 15 years (Shapiro 1987), but a study conducted in northern Oman recorded a maximum age of 25 years and total length of 48 cm (J. McIlwain unpublished data). It is thought tospawn during seasonal periods and form spawning aggregations (Shapiro 1987). In New Caledonia, the sex ratio is reported as 1:6 males to females, with a size at maturity of females at 19.5 cm and 29 cm total length for males (IRD database)."," Heavy fishing pressure is a potential threat to this species on a localised level, but this is not known to be driving major declines on a global level at this time.","This species occurs in marine protected areas that are within its range. The Cape d’Aguilar Marine Reserve of Hong Kong is a no-take area (Cornish 2000). Trawling has been banned in Hong Kong since 2013, which may reduce fishing effort on this species. The trade limit for this species in Indonesia is set at first maturity (25 cm total length; Mous and Pet 2016). In the Maldives there is a size and quota limit for this species in the export trade (Sattar and Adams 2005, Marine Research Centre, Maldives and Marine Conservation Society 2011). There are size and bag limits for this species in Queensland, Australia (Department of Primary Industries 2003).","This is a commercially valued species in many areas. It is takenwith hook and line, traps and trawls (Heemstra and Randall 1993, To 2009). In Hong Kong, it was caught by long-liners and trawlers on mud grounds along the coast and was most abundant in depths between 70 to 90 m (Chan 1968). It is also taken by hook and line and trawl in India(Kandula et al. 2015). It is taken as bycatch in prawn trawl fisheries in Northern Territory, Australia (Stobutzki et al. 2001, Errity 2003). It is also taken for the live reef fish trade in the Philippines (Prattet al.2000, Padillaet al.2003). It is one of the most common species in the mariculture industry of southern China, southeast Asia and the Middle East (Leung et al. 1999). Live reef fish import data from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department record large quantities of 'other groupers' and 'other marine fishes' as being imported from Thailand. Thailand and Malaysia are important sources for so-called 'cultured' species including Epinephelus areolatus/E. bleekeri, which are amongst the 12 most commonly available species imported to Hong Kong (http://www.traffic.org/reef-fish/executivesummary.html). Fingerlings are wild-caught in Vietnam and Thailand (Sadovy 2000) and no hatcheries are known for this species (Y. Sadovy pers. comm.)."

As a result of overfishing, declines have reported in the Persian Gulf, mainland China and Malaysia based on sporadic studies. In addition, large amounts of juveniles are taken for grow-out in several countries in its range and the species is often marketed in its immature size range. It is also sold in the Live Reef Fish Food trade centered in Hong Kong, which further amplifies overfishing in certain areas. Global-level declines may be occurring, but long-term quantitative data are not available across a large portion of its range. Therefore, it is listed as Data Deficient. Further action is needed to reduce fishing effort, especially in the South China Sea and improvements in fishery monitoring and data collection are also needed to fill population data gaps. Research on life history parameters is needed to estimate generation length. The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species is distributed in theIndo-West Pacific from the Persian Gulf to Taiwan, Indonesia and northern Australia (southwest to Shark Bay, Western Australia). It also occurs in the Solomon Islands (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). It is not yet confirmed from Japan, but may occur there. Its distribution does not include the islands of Micronesia or Polynesia (Heemstra and Randall 1993<span style=''>).Its depth range is three to 104 metres. Specific localities: Australia (Northern Territory, Western Australia), Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China (Fujian, Guangdong), Hong Kong, India (Andhra Pradesh, Karaikal, Kerala, Mahé, Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu, Yanam), Indonesia (Java, Kalimantan, Moluccas, Sulawesi, Sumatra), Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, Sarawak), Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Viet Nam.","This species is widespread, but apparently no longer abundant in large parts of its range. There is evidence for recent declines in Malaysia and serious declines have potentiallyoccurredin the South China Sea. Population decline may be occurring at the global level, especially due to pressure to supply the Live Reef Fish Food trade, but quantitative data are lacking in a large portion of its range. Persian Gulf: This species was regionally listed as Near Threatened in the Persian Gulf based on declines in catch and abundance of large epinephelids over the past 10 years.Epinephelus bleekeriis similar in size and habitat toEpinephelus coioides, which is heavily targeted species in the Persian Gulf, but it does not occur in the fisheries statistics collected in Abu Dhabi (Grandcourt et al. 2011). It comprises a relatively small proportion of bycatch in the Iranian shrimp trawl fishery (0.02-0.07%; Paighambari and Daliri 2012), the Iranian cutlassfish trawl fishery (less than 0.1%; Raeisiet al.2011) and the Kuwaiti shrimp fishery (Chenet al.2013).During a trawl survey conducted in 2003-2004 in the Oman Sea and Persian Gulf, this comprised between 0.05 to 0.12% of the biomass (Valinassabet al.2006).Fishing effort is likely to increase in the next 10-15 years in the Persian Gulf. China: An underwater survey conducted in Daya Bay, south China in 2015 did not record this species (average survey effort was 21.2 man-hours; To and Shea 2016). Trawl surveys conducted in the South China Sea reported that the density of this species was 3.5 kg/km<sup>2</sup>in 1964/1965 and 1.49 kg/km<sup>2</sup>in 2002 to 2004 (Chen 2009), but no data between these years are available to estimate or detect a trend. Hong Kong: This species was “moderately abundant” during underwater reef fish surveys in Hong Kong conducted from 1995 to 1999 (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). This species was recorded in 6% of the underwater surveys conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Hong Kong coral and rocky reefs and the density index was 1.55 out of 4 (Shea and Ho 2016). It was the fourth most abundant species observed during a wet market survey of wild-caught grouper in Hong Kong during 2004 to 2006, and nearly all were immature (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). A wet market survey conducted in 2012/2013 reported it to rank 12th by abundance (i.e., 2.4%) among all groupers that were both locally caught and imported, and almost all were immature (S. Lam unpublished data). In Hong Kong, most medium-bodied grouper species have declined. According to mariculturists in Hong Kong, the supply of wild-caught fingerlings/juveniles for grow-out has declined presumably due to overfishing. In southern China, fingerlings are near extirpated (Sadovy 2000), which suggests a decline in the adult source populations has occurred throughout Southeast Asia (L. Min pers. comm. 2007). However, this could also be attributed to the switch of culturist choices after the disease outbreak in the early 2000s. Indonesia: This species was not observed during underwater surveys conducted in Indonesiafrom 2004 to 2011 (S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016). It comprises part of the deepwater fishery, and of 336 observed individuals, 2% were immature and 74% were mega spawners. Overall, at least 90% of individuals for sale in Indonesia were mature, and the spawning potential ratio was nearly 100%. Based on this, the population is not overexploited and is considered stable as of 2014 to 2016 (Mous and Pet 2016). Taiwan: This speciesis rare in Taiwan (KT Shao pers. comm. 2016). Malaysia: Wild-caught immature individuals of this species are utilized by the mariculture industry in Malaysia, specifically inKg Teruakan, Nr. P. Sakar, Lahad Datu, Sabah (Daw 2004). Australia: <em style='font-weight: bold;'>This species is a<em style='font-weight: bold;'>minor component of the Western Australia trap fishery. A total of 46 to 55 kg was caught in Onslow, Western Australia in 1986 to 1987 (Moran et al. 1987). Solomon Islands: A market survey conducted in Honiara in the Solomon Islands recorded that this species comprised 0.5% of grouper catch and sizes ranged between 22 and 55 cm total length (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data), which suggests at least some portion of the Solomon Island catch is immature. India: <em style='font-weight: bold;'>This species comprised 3% of the grouper catches in the north Andhra region of India during 2009 to 2011, and the size typically ranged from 26 to 37 cm total length (Kandula et al. 2015), which suggests most were immature. It rarely or sporadically appeared in trawl catches in southern Kerala, India (Naomi et al. 2011).",decreasing,"This demersal species inhabits mostly shallow coral and rocky banks, can be associated with non-reefal and turbid habitat,and is not known from well-developed coral reefs (Randall 1995). Juveniles can be commonly taken in estuaries. Its maximum total length is 76 cm (Chan 1968). Life history data are lacking, but due to similarities, Epinephelus maculatus is considered an appropriate proxy to estimate generation length. The age at first maturity for E. maculatus females is 2.8 years and males is 4 years and longevity is 13 years (Rhodes et al. 2016). When applying an age at first reproduction of three years and longevity of 13 years, its estimated generation length is eight years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.",Overfishing is a major threat to this species.,There are no species-specific conservation measures. It occurs in some marine protected areas that overlap its range.,"This species is of minor commercial importance to fisheries, and comprises a portion of deepwater fisheries within its range. Itis a commercially valuable species in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (Valinassabet al.2006). It is an excellent food fish and collected using hook and line, longlines and trawls (Heemstra and Randall 1993).It is sold in the Life Reef Food Fish Trade in Hong Kong (Donaldsonet al.2003) and the Philippines (Prattet al.2000, Padillaet al.2003). Wild caught juveniles/fingerlingsare also utilized for aquaculture (grow-out in sea cages and pens)in the live fish market in Hong Kong (Lee and Sadovy 1998, Donaldsonet al. 2003). Thailand and Malaysia are important sources for so-called 'cultured' (i.e., wild-captured juveniles) species andEpinephelus bleekeriisamongst the 12 most commonly available species imported to Hong Kong (http://www.traffic.org/reef-fish/executivesummary.html). Juveniles are also commonly taken in estuaries in the Philippines (Prattet al.2000, Padillaet al.2003) and Thailand (Vidthayanon and Premcharoen 2002), Malaysia, southern China, Vietnam (Tuan 2003) and Indonesia. Seine net, scoop net and push net are mainly used for collecting small fish of 1 to 3 cm (Tuan and Hambrey 2000).Fingerlings are either locally grown out or sold to Taiwan or Hong Kong (Sadovy 2000). It is less frequently cultured in Hong Kong as of 2002/2003 due to disease problems(Shek 2003). It also occurs as bycatch in several Persian Gulf commercial fisheries (Raeisiet al.2011,Hosseiniet al.2012,Paighambari and Daliri 2012,Chenet al.2013), commercial trawl fisheries in India (Jameset al.1996) and the trap fishery of Western Australia (Moranet al.1988)."

There are signs of localised declines due to fishing effort in some areas, particularly in the Seychelles, and suspected declines in others (Indonesia). Catches of this species are generally low in comparison to other groupers in many parts of its range, which may be a function of its deeper depth preference. Population declines are not suspected on a global level at this time; therefore, it is listed as Least Concern. It is recommended that catches, particularly in areas where groupers are lumped, should be monitored carefully and frequently to provide more species-specific quantitative information.","ThisIndo-Pacific species is distributed from Yemen to KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa), east to the western Pacific (including Madagascar), north to southern Japan and south to New Caledonia (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Records from the Persian Gulf are apparently misidentifications of Epinephelus polylepis; and records from the Red Sea are likely to be the newly-described E. geoffroyi (Randall et al. 2013). Although Randall et al. (2013) stated there are no confirmed records for continental waters of Asia or Australia, and none for the East Indies, except one from Papua New Guinea, it has since been reported from India, the eastern Andaman Sea, Timor, and off Northern Territory, Australia. Rome and Newman (2010) report it from Western Australia on offshore islands and shoals, and it features in landings on the east and west coasts of India. Its depth range is four to 280 metres. It is known from the following specific localities: Djibouti (M. Samoilys and H. Choat pers. comm. 2016), Aden (Yemen), Somalia (Darar 1994, Mann and Fielding 2000; possible misidentification), Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal), southwestern Madagascar (R. Myers distributional database 2016), east coast of Madagascar (A. Pages, Refrigepech Est. pers. comm.), Comoros, Seychelles, Réunion, Mauritius, Maldives, India, Indian islands (Andaman, Nicobars, Lakshadweep), Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand (East Burma Sea), Cambodia, southern Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia/Malaysia (northern Sumatra, Malaysian peninsula, Sunda shelf, Bali), Western Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and Vanuatu, Samoa, southern Japan, Fiji, Taiwan (R. Myers distributional database 2016), China (including Hong Kong).","Epinephelus chlorostigma is an abundant species throughout most of its range, and is naturally uncommon in some regions. It is infrequently recorded in underwater surveys throughout its range (e.g., Chateret al.1995, Robertson et al.1996, Pereira 2003, Reef Life Survey, PROCFish); however, the species could be more abundant in the deeper portion of its depth range which is beyond the depths of typical survey effort. It was rarely recorded (three individuals out of 1,278 grouper individuals sampled) in a survey of boat catches from non-coral reefs off the central KwaZulu-Natal coast from 1985 to 1987 (Oceanographic Research Institute unpubl. data). In the same area, only two out of 365 grouper individuals sampled from commercial and recreational offshore boats from 1994 to 1996 were identified as this species (Mann et al. 1997), and none were observed during 2008 to 2009 (Dunlop 2011). It was moderately common (n=31 individuals, 4.5% of groupers) on the North Kenya Banks in the late 1950s (Morgans 1964), and uncommonly observed (n=4 of 130 groupers) during sampling of hook and line catches in the mid-1970s (Nzioka 1977). It was occasionally recorded in semi-industrial trap catches in central Mozambique from 1997 to 1998 (n=23 out of 1,304 grouper individuals)(Abdulaet al.2000). Only one individual out of &gt;9,000 grouper individuals was observed in a survey of the semi-industrial line fishery in southern Mozambique from 2002 to 2014 (R. Mutombene unpublished data). It was un<span class='MsoCommentReference'>commonly landed by contemporary artisanal fisheriestargeting groupers off southern Kenya in February to July 2007(one out of 950 grouper individuals) (Agembe et al. 2010). This species was commonly captured in the early 2000s in a commercial linefishing fleet out of Tamatave, Madagascar, and comprised about 20% of all grouper caught (total grouper catch was about 30 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>) (A. Pages pers. comm.). It has been reported in catches from Reunion, but catch is lumped with several other grouper species (L. Miossec pers. comm.).  Catches from Oman are likely misidentifications ofE. gabriellae(J. McIlwain<span lang='EN-IN'>pers. comm).In India, landings fluctuated and were generally negligible between 2007 to 2014, except for 115 tons landed in 2008 (R. Nair pers. comm.; see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). Only nine out of 2,058 grouper individuals (0.4%) were identified as this species at landing sites on the east coast of India in 2009 to 2011 (Kandula et al. 2015), and 1% of groupertrawl landings on the west coast of India were this species (Manojkumar 2005). This species is reportedly abundant on seamounts off the west coast of India (Bineesh et al. 2014). It is reported from the Maldives, but no catch data are available (Sattar and Adams 2005, Sattar et al. 2011).Percentage contributions of this species to grouper catches from “essentially unexploited” deep-slope reefs were moderate to low in Melanesia (7.1%), Micronesia (2.4%) and Polynesia (0.2%) (Dalzell and Preston 1992 as reported in Dalzell et al.1996). It contributed 1% to the total catch (~7% of all groupers) in the Indonesian (south-east) deep-water snapper fishery in 2014-2016, and spawning potential ratio was &lt; 25%, suggesting that the stock was overexploited (Mous and Pet 2016a,b). Out of 5,425 groupers sampled in the Honiara fish market in the Solomons in 2015-2016, only 14 individuals of this species were observed (0.3%) (K. Rhodes pers. comm). This species contributed only 0.1% to the overall number of serranids in markets in Pohnpei (Micronesia) in January-May 2006 (Rhodes and Tupper 2007).  In most years, this is the principal species of grouper landed by artisanal hook-and-line fisheries in the Seychelles. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) for grouper in the inshore handline fishery in the Seychelles, of which E. chlorostigma is one of the main species, significantly declined after 1990, from over 0.6 to less than 0.3 kg/fisher/hr (Grandcourt and Cesar 2002). CPUE in the offshore schooner line fishery also declined significantly, from around 3.5 kg/man<sup>-day</sup> in 1986 to just over 1.0 kg/man<sup>-day</sup> since 2002. By contrast, CPUE in the whaler handline fishery has remained relatively stable since 1990 (between 0.5 and 1.2 kg/man<sup>-day</sup>), but effort estimation was confounded by a degree of target switching (demersal to pelagic) which may have varied from year to year and was not reliably accounted for in the surveys (Grandcourt and Cesar 2002). Assessments conducted in the early 1990s indicated that the fishery was exploited around maximum sustainable yield (MSY) levels (Mees 1992), localised depletion was observed and populations were considered vulnerable to pulse and sequential fishing as the whaler and schooner fisheries expanded and a mothership-dory fishery operated (Mees 1996). Landings declined significantly (130 to 60 tons) after the cessation of the mothership-dory fishery in 1994. Since then, landings have been variable but trending towards a decline (37 tons in 2015; see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information).Though the results of a recent stock assessment are not unequivocal for this species, standardised CPUE based on a subset of the fleet data was fairly constant from 1985 to 1996, declined sharply in 1998 and peaked in 2002. Since then it has shown a general decline to 50% of the 2002 level by 2013 (Gutierrez 2015; see Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information). Albeit a standardized CPUE, Gutierrez (2015) cautioned that changes in fleet dynamics could have affected the trend. Moussac (1996) attributed a skewed sex ratio (F:M) of 2.4:1 to fishing, and noted that a more balanced ratio of 1.1:1 occurs where populations are not so heavily fished. Further, more than 50% of the catch was immature raising the possibility of recruitment overfishing. Recent annual estimates of length at first capture (Lc50: 31-36 cm) are slightly greater than 0.5L∞.",stable,"This species inhabitsa wide depth range (four to 280 m) on coral and rocky reefs, outer reef slopes and seagrass beds (Heemstra and Randall 1993). In the Seychelles, it is common across the Mahe Plateau and surrounding banks, especially at depths from 40 to 60 m. It is more abundant over rough rubble and coralline areas, but has been taken in (experimental) trawls over more sandy areas (J. Robinson pers. comm.). In the Seychelles, it frequents the shelf edges of the banks and has been fished down to depths of 250 m (Intes and Bach 1989). It is less common on the atolls to the south of Seychelles and appears absent on shallow reefs (Pears 2005). In the South China Sea, it has also been recorded from mud bottoms. Its maximum total length is 75 to 81 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993, MRAG 1996, Oceanographic Research Institute unpublished data). This species is protogynous, with sex change first occurring at around 34 cm total length, and the first active males appearing at 37 cm (Moussac 1996). Females mature between 23 and 29 cm total length (Heemstra and Randall 1993). In the Seychelles, Moussac (1996) reported maturity at about 31 cm. Morgans (1982) reported maturity at 25 cm standard length in Kenya (Sanders et al. 1988). The spawning season of Epinephelus chlorostigma in the Seychelles was protracted, occurring between November and April and with peaks at the beginning and end of that period (Sanders et al. 1988). These peak periods correspond to the inter-tropical monsoon months. While a few fishers have reported the formation of spawning aggregations (Robinson et al. 2004), mating and spatial patterns of spawning are unverified. It is considered unlikely that transient aggregations occur (or used to occur) in this species, as large aggregations of common target species are generally well known to fishers (J. Robinson pers. comm.).  Estimates of natural mortality using the growth parameters of Mees (1992) and Sanders et al. (1988) vary from 0.43 yr<sup>-1</sup>, using Pauly’s (1980) method, to between 0.37 and 0.39 yr-1 using Ralston’s (1987) model, which is considered more reliable for slow-growing fish. One generation length (GL) is estimated at about 18 years (based on: GL = age of first reproduction (4 years) + [z* length of the reproductive period (29 years)];zvalue of 0.5).","Unsustainable fishing pressure in some areas may be causing localised declines, but this is not considered a major threat on a global-level. Fishing effort may be increasing in some areas (Cunningham and Bodiguel 2006, Flewelling and Hosch 2006), but effort generally occurs in only the shallower portion of this species' wide depth range.","This species occurs in some protected areas within its range. In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, most of the north coast and the adjacent coast of southern Mozambique is protected by a ~ 220 km long marine protected area in which no demersal fishing is allowed.There are also marine protected areas in northern Mozambique, Seychelles, Tanzania and Kenya which offer protection. In South Africa, a maximum of five individuals of this species may be retained by recreational fishers per day; there are no limits for commercial fishers. In Mozambique, a maximum of 10 individuals of demersal species may be retained by recreational fishers.",This species is utilized in fisheries throughout its range.

Choat pers. comm. 2013). It is exploited by artisanal, small-scale (e.g., Rhodes and Tupper 2007) and large-scale commercial fisheries in much of its range and is targeted with other groupers by the live reef food fish trade (LRFFT) (Sadovy and Liu 2006).  Pacific: This species comprised 13.2% of the overall catch of serranids by weight in Pohnpei, Micronesia (Rhodes and Tupper 2007), but was rarely observed during a rapid underwater survey conducted in the same area (Allen and Stone 2005). It comprised 28% of spearfishing catch, 8% of hook and line catch and 4% of net fishery catches in the coral reef fishery from January to June 2006 in Pohnpei, Micronesia (Rhodes et al. 2008). It is also an important component of spearfishing catches in parts of Indonesia (Muttaqin et al. 2013). It is targeted by the LRFFT in Indonesia (Sadovy and Liu 2004) and possibly other locales where this fishery is active. In New Caledonia, it comprised only 0.6% of experimental catch (IRD database). It also comprised about 1% of 5,425 grouper individuals sampled in the Honiara fish market in the Solomons in 2015-2016 (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). It comprised 0.36% of the overall catch based in 12-month survey of commercial landings in Chuuk, Micronesia (J. Cuetos-Beno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data). In comparison to other serranids, this species had a low abundance (less than 1 per 1,000 m²) during underwater surveys conducted along sections of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia (Pears 2005). Relatively low abundances were also observed in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands (G. Allen unpublished data). Densities of 50 fish/km<sup>2</sup>of reef have been reported from Fiji and New Caledonia (IRD database). Only 1 individual of this species was observed out of &gt; 31,000 grouper individuals recorded during underwater surveys of the NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Programme. Only 17 out of &gt; 21,000 observations of serranids were of this species (Global Reef Life Survey database http://reeflifesurvey.imas.utas.edu.au/portal/search accessed October 2014). Only 11 out of almost 16,000 grouper individuals observed in underwater surveys conducted from 2002 to 2009 on Pacific shallow reefs were identified as this species (Pacific Regional Oceanic and Coastal Fisheries Development Programme).   Western Indian Ocean: FAO landings statistics for 'whitespotted grouper' are only reported by Saudi Arabia, and landings ranged between one and three tons from 2010 to 2014. In the Persian Gulf, it was not recorded in the annual statistics reports of the United Arab Emirates from 2001-2012, nor is it identified in the review on fish and fisheries of the Persian Gulf by Grandcourt (2012).Itis one of the least commonly observed groupers on reefs of Kuwait (Carpenteret al.1997). During underwater surveys conducted in May and December 1985, a total of 26individuals of this species were observed at a site northeast of Bahrain (Smith and Saleh 1987). It was not observed during underwater reef fish censuses in the southern Persian Gulf (J. Burt and D. Feary pers. comm. 2013), nor at several inshore and offshore reefs off Qatar (A. Ayling unpublished data). In southern Kenya, it was the most commonly recorded grouper (15.5 and 27% of ca. 900 grouper individuals) at two artisanal fishery landing sites from February to July 2007 (Agembe et al. 2010) and the third most commonly observed grouper in landings from December 2013 to July 2014 (Ogongo et al. 2015). This species was the secondmost commonly observed grouper (n = 43 of 339 grouper individuals) in an underwater survey conducted in southern Kenya in February-July 2007 (Ogongo et al. 2015). It was not recorded in reef fishery catches off eastern South Africa in the 1980s, 1990s or 2000s, nor was it recorded during underwater surveys conducted in the 1980s and 2010s in a marine protected area on the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal (Oceanographic Research Institute unpublished data).<span lang='EN-IN'>In Mafia Island, Tanzania in 2011, underwater surveys recorded an average of 0.28 indiv/1,000 m² in no-take zones, but no individuals were recorded in exploited areas (Gaspareet al. 2015).In Mozambique, it comprised an average of 0.07% by number and 0.14 % by weight of the overall semi-industrial linefisherycatch from 2002 to 2014 (estimated range in annual total fleet catch of 0.14-1.5 tons), and had a very variable, low nominal catch per unit effort (Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). It was a very minor component of<span lang='EN-IN'>the live reef fish trade in the Maldives in 2010 (Sattaret al. 2011).In the Maldives, its was observed during underwater survey very infrequently as compared to other groupers in 2008 and 2010 (~0.1 fish/500 m²). Based on 156 underwater surveys conducted at 41 sites in four atolls of the Maldives in 2010-2011, the total estimated biomass was 360 tons and a preliminary maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 49 tons (Anon 2011).It is relatively rare in the Seychelles, with only ca. 0.3 fish/1,000 m² observed in 2001-2002 (Pears 2005).",stable,"This species inhabits rocky or coral-rich areas of deep lagoons, channels and outer reef slopes, usually in or near caves (Newmanet al.1997, Anon 2011). It is often found in greater abundances on fringing and intermediate reefs than on barrier reefs. The species appears to prefer certain types of corals (branching or tabular forms), but it is not dependent on live reef habitat (J.H. Choat pers. comm. 2013). Juveniles are found in mangroves and tide pools. It feeds on fish and crustaceans and its maximum length is 76 cm. There has been some evidence of spawning aggregation formation, but it is not yet confirmed. Little is known of its reproductive biology or general life history, including longevity and size or age at sexual maturity.","This species is typically a relatively minor component of most reef fisheries, and global level declines are not known at this time. It may be vulnerable to overfishing by small-scale commercial fishers that typically operate in developing island countries such as Pohnpei and Palau (Rhodes and Tupper 2007).","There are no species-specific conservation measures. Some regional conservation measures are in place for coral reef areas that benefit this species, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and marine protected areas in Pohnpei, New Caledonia and Palau, where there are no-take zones, size limits for SCUBA-based fishing, destructive fishing gears (dynamite, poisons) and seasonal closures around reproductive periods for serranid species (Wantiez et al. 1997, Gaspare et al. 2015). Further research is needed on life history parameters of this species as well as population trends, especially in areas where it is exploited."," This species is caught and sold in markets for human consumption using spears, hook and line and traps primarily in mixed-catch reef fisheries."

It is exploited in several parts of its range. It is considered overexploited in Oman and the Persian Gulf, with estimated declines of 51% over the past three generations in the Persian Gulf population. Based on the dominance of juveniles in landings, it is also potentially overfished in Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, but quantitative data are lacking. Global catch is reported primarily only from two main areas: the Persian Gulf/Gulf of Oman and China/Hong Kong, which has declined by 40% over the past 27 years or two generation lengths. It is under effective management in Australia and Indonesia, but conservation measures are not considered effective elsewhere in its range. Overfishing is a threat in certain localities, but is not known to be a major threat on a global-level at this time; therefore it is listed as Least Concern. Improved monitoring of catches and management where it is heavilyfished is recommended.The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific Ocean fromDurban, South Africa; north along East Africa, including Madagascar, Reunion and Mauritius, to the Red Sea and Persian Gulf; east to Palau and Fiji; north to the Ryukyu Islands, Japan; and south to the Arafura Sea and northern Australia (Heemstra and Randall 1993). It has also migrated through the Suez Canal to the eastern Mediterranean (Randall 1995). Its depth range is zero to 100 metres.","According to reconstructed catch data compiled by Sea Around Us, global catch of this species (including data reported to FAO) has been declining since 1987 by 40%from 15 tonnes to 9 tonnes in 2014, which is a period of 27 years. Landings are primarily from Hong Kong, China and Iran and secondarilyfrom Saudi Arabia (Pauly and Zeller 2015).It is inferred that fishing effort has not declined, and has likely increased. Though declining in parts of its range, population decline on a global level is not known to come close to qualifying for the thresholds under Criterion A. Western Indian Ocean: Thisspecies is commonly captured in the grouper fishery off southern Kenya (total catch was about 40 kg in 2007) (Agembe et al. 2010). It is one of the most abundant groupers recorded in underwater surveys off western India (Sluka and Lazarus 2010). In the central eastern coast of India, Epinephelus coioides comprised 22% of catch in 2009 to 2011 (Kandula et al. 2015).During a trawl survey conducted in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea in 2003/2004, this species comprised 0.2 to 0.5% of the total biomass (Valinassabet al.2006). This species is overfished in Oman and the Persian Gulf (Grandcourt et al. 2005, Grandcourt et al. 2009,Grandcourt et al. 2011, McIlwainet al. 2016). Epinephelus coioides is found at higher densities on artificial reefs than on natural habitats in the UAE, which may amplify exploitation (Feary et al. 2011). In a 2013 regional Red List assessment of its population in the Persian Gulf, landings from Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iran and Saudi Arabia declined by an average of 51% over three generation lengths (27 years). From 1979-2012, landings of E. coioides in Kuwait declined from 318.5 mt in 1979 to 119.8 mt in 2012, representing a 62% decline over 33 years (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013).From 2004-2012, landings of E. coioides in Bahrain declined from 572.3 mt in 2004 to 161.6 mt in 2012, representing a 72% decline over eight years (E. Abdulqader pers. comm. 2013). From 2005-2011, FAO landings of E. coioides reported by Qatar declined from 2,093 mt in 2005 to 1,292 mt in 2011, representing a 38% decline over seven years (FAO 2013). Over the last 10 years (2002-2012), aggregate serranid landings declined by 36% (1233 to 788 mt) (Annual Fisheries Statistics Report for Abu Dhabi Emirate 2002, 2013). A fisheries resource survey conducted in 2002 in UAE waters recorded a 13% decline in abundance forE. coioides(Shallard 2003). From 1999-2012, FAO landings of E. coioides reported by Iran declined by 24% from 4,460 mt in 1999 to 3,399 mt in 2012 (FAO 2013). Pacific Ocean: In Indonesia, the fishery for this species is not considered overfished, catch is not populated with juveniles and overfishing risk is relatively low (Mous and Pet 2016). Underwater surveys conducted on Hong Kong reefs from 2014 to 2016 described this species as 'uncommon', with a sighting frequency of 2.7 (sightings per trip), although this does not necessarily reflect its population status in Hong Kong (Shea and Ho 2016). Amarket survey conducted in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006 observed 689 wild-caught individuals of this species, of which 93% were caught in Hong Kong waters and all were considered to be immature (To 2009, To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). Asurvey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Hong Kong restaurants and wet markets, observed 4,046 individuals ofE. coioides,which comprised about 15.7% of all groupersby number,and 99% were immature (included samples from mariculture, Lam 2013). This speciesis common in Taiwan (K-T. Shao pers. comm. 2016), and 11 and 19 tonnes were landed in Taiwan in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Taiwan Fishery Year Book 2014-2015).A spawning aggregation of 1,000 to 5,000 individuals ofEpinephelus coioideshas been reported from Papua New Guinea. Fishers reported that they landed between 200 and 500 fish in a night 30 to 40 years ago, whereas by 2003, they landed between 50 and 100 fish in a night, a decline of 50% (Hamilton 2003). A market survey conducted in Honiara, Solomon Islands in 2015 to 2016 recorded that 54 out of 5425 grouper individualswere identified as E. coioidesand sizes ranged from 22 to 83 cm total length, with 41% being immature (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). In Australia, this species isheavily fished in inshore habitats, but remains common due to its high growth and population turnover rates (H. Choat pers. comm. 2017).",decreasing,"This species inhabits coral reefs typically along continental coastlines and large islands (Carpenteret al.1997, Grandcourtet al.2005). Juveniles often occur in estuaries over sand, mud and gravel substrate and amongst mangroves (Kailola et al. 1993, Randall et al. 1997). It primarily consumesfishes, shrimps, crabs and other benthic crustaceans (Grandcourtet al.2005). Its maximum total length is 172 cm and is a diandric protogynous hermaphrodite (Grandcourt et al. 2009). Juvenile sexual differentiation in this species can be significantly influenced by social factors (Liu and Mitcheson 2011). In the Persian Gulf, it has been aged to at least 22 years (Mathews and Samuel 1991, Grandcourt 2006, M. Abdullah pers. comm. 2010). Female age at first maturity is four years at 34 cm total length. Males reachmaturity at 67.5 cmand 7.5 years and transition occurs at 50 to 75 cm at 4 to 8 years of age (M. Abdullah pers. comm. 2010). McIlwain et al. (2016) reported a size and age at 50% maturity for females of 58 cm total length and four years, respectively. Based on a longevity of 22 years, age of first maturity of 4 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 12.5 years.It forms seasonal spawning aggregations in the Persian Gulf from March to June (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Grandcourt et al. 2009) and in New Caledonia in late October to early December (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2004). A spawning aggregation of 1,000 to 5,000 individuals of Epinephelus coioides has been reported from Papua New Guinea that forms in the muddy/sandy bottom of a large shallow bay for three to four days in every month of the year. At night, the fish sleep partially buried in the mud (Hamilton 2003).","Overfishing is a major threat to populations in the Persian Gulf (Grandcourt et al. 2005) and China, but this is not considered a major threat on a global-level at this time. Degradation of estuaries (juvenile habitat) and coral reefs (adult habitat) may also impact this species (Burke et al. 2002).","Conservation measures directed to the Persian Gulf population have included reduction in fishing effort, modification of gear selectivity and the introduction of juvenile escape panels in the demersal trap fishery.In Qatar, fishery regulations include restricted mesh size, number of vessels, trip frequency and licensing (A. Al-Kuwary pers. comm. 2013). However, these measures were found to be ineffective (Grandcourt et al. 2011). Suggested alternative measures include a moratorium on the use of traps in the offshore demersal fishery of Abu Dhabi(Grandcourt et al. 2011). There are no restrictions on fishing effort for this species in Oman(McIlwain et al. 2016). This species is under total protection in New South Wales, Australia (Public Consultation Document 2002) and there is a strict length limit enforced in Queensland, Australia (Fishing Industry Organization and Marketing Amendment Regulation 1993). This species wasreleased on Hong Kong artificial reefs in Yan Chau Tong and Hoi Ha Wan Marine Park in 2001 as a part of restocking trial (Cheung 2001), it is not known if this improved recovery.","This species is important to fisheries through much of its range. It supplies live and chilled fish markets, both domestic and international. Mariculture of this species is extensive in Southeast Asia (Sadovy 2000). It is cultured for local consumption in Thailand and Singaporeand for export using mainly wild-caught juvenile seed (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Yashiro 1996). Hatchery production has recently increased. Juveniles are still taken from the wild for grow-out in mariculture operations, but this is very poorly documented. This species is one of the most common next toE. awoaraused to supply the largemariculture industry of Fujian, China; however,E. coioidesjuveniles are mainly sourced from hatchery production, not wild-caught fisheries (Liu and Sadovy 2009). Spawning aggregations aretargeted by local fishers via spear in Papua New Guinea (Hamilton 2003).Itis the most important reef-associated, commercial species in the Persian Gulf and is mainly collected via demersal traps (Grandcourt et al. 2005) as well as longlines and trawls (Carpenter et al. 1997). In northern Oman, fishermen target this species with semicircular wire basket traps (McIlwain et al. 2016). It is also commonly taken as bycatch in the shrimp and cutlassfish trawl fisheries of Iran (Raeisiet al. 2011,Paighambari and Daliri 2012, Hosseiniet al. 2012)."

Further research on its life history would also be beneficial.","Thisspecies is distributed in the western Pacific from the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailandto the Marshall Islands and Fiji, and eastern Australia (to southern Queensland) to southern Japan and the Ogasawara Islands. Specifically, it is known from Flores, the Molucca Islands and the Watubela Islands in Indonesia, from Luzon, Panay and Mindanao in the Philippines, Madang in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Allen and Erdmann 2012).

Records fromthe Indian Ocean are consideredEpinephelus flavocaeruleus in the Indian Ocean (Myers 1989). Its depth range is 2-150 metres.","This species is relatively uncommon throughout most of its range, but is common within some locales (e.g., New Caledonia). New Caledonia: An underwater survey of spawning aggregations of this species has been conducted every spring and recruitment surveys have been conducted every summer in New Caledonia’s southwestern lagoon since 1992. The fishery for this species in New Caledonia is also monitored by the Fishery Service, and commercial catch and fishing effort indicate aggregation size has declined over time, with the population in collapse by 1998. Following a large recruitment event in 1997-1998, this species became one of the most common serranid species observed in New Caledonia markets. Experimental fishing indicated that there was an increase in abundance of approximately 30% from 1987 to 2000. Recruitment success has been highly variable through at least 2001 and the average weight of individuals (3.5 kg) remained stable over time (IRD database). Experimental fishing trials conducted in New Caledonia from 1984 to 2005 captured 383 individuals of this species, the sex ratio was ~1:10 (males-to-females), the smallest male measured a total length of 52 cm and the smallest female 31.5 cm.The collapse in spawning aggregations could be due to recreational fishing activity, but recruitment success could also vary depending on the cyclical ENSO climate conditions. High population densities may promote parasite or disease transmission, and in Epinephelus cyanopodus, aggregations are thought to increase transmission of monogeneans (Sigura and Justine 2008).In this case, the size of spawning aggregations is not considered an appropriate index of population status (Chauvet 2005). Fiji: This is one of several grouper species that aggregate in large numbers in, or near, the channels and passes of Fiji’s outer reefs during a few months each year (Sadovy 2005). It evidently aggregates in relatively shallow waters which may have caused it to be particularly susceptible to overfishing and accessible to spear fishers (Hamilton et al. 2012). According to a recent study, catchesof this species have become substantially reduced in Fiji relative to other similar commercially sought-after grouper species (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Batibasaga in press 2017). Australia: This species is relatively uncommon in Australia.<em style='font-weight: bold;'>On the Great Barrier Reef, it occurs on mid–outer shelf reefs at densities of 0.03 to 0.18 fish/100 m² (R. Pears unpublished data). Out of about 8,270 sightings of grouper species recorded in the Reef Life Survey global reef fish dataset for Australia, only 14 were ofE. cyanopodus.Underwater surveys conducted on the Great Barrier Reef recorded very few male individuals of this species and the length distribution of this species was dominated by undetermined inactive females, immature females and mature females. The absence of males suggests larger individuals may be associated with habitats which were not sampled, from reefs at depths greater than ~20 m (Maplestone et al. 2009). Indonesia and the Philippines: Out of about 1,100 grouper species sightings recorded in the Reef Life Survey from 2009-2015 forIndonesia, none were E. cyanopodus. In the Philippines national database, few of the groupers recorded in ports over the recent decade were identified as E. cyanopodus (Santos et al. 2017). Hong Kong: This species was common on Pratas Reef and Macclesfield Bank off Hong Kong during the 1960s (Chan 1968). Currently, it is rarely seen in local markets or noted by local Hong Kong fishermen (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017). According to retail market surveys, it is one of the top 20 grouper species (by number) imported into Hong Kong as part of the live reef food fish trade (F. Chan unpublished data). It is not, however, officiallymonitored by the city’s Census and Statistics Department Harmonized international coding system. There are concerns that pressures appear to be growing on wild groupers traded live, while chilled/frozen fish are also attracting more attention from Asian markets, and that this species is likely vulnerable to these pressures (Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. in press 2017).",unknown,"This species inhabits isolated coral heads and patch reefs in lagoons or bays, but can also occur in outer reef areas (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Larger males may occur in depths greater than 20 metres (Mapleston et al. 2009). It usually swims out in the open, several meters above the bottom (Myers 1999) and can bereadily caught by anglers at night (Grant 1975). It primarily consumessand-dwelling fish and crustaceans (Thollot 1996, Kulbickiet al.2005).This species forms seasonal spawning aggregations (e.g., Dumbea Pass in New Caledonia) that can be mixed with other grouper species, especiallyEpinephelus polyphekadionandE. fuscoguttatus(Chauvet 2005, M. Kulbicki pers. comm.). Its life history is poorly understood in general, but longevity is thought to be greater than 4 years. Its maximum total length is 100 cm (Allen and Erdmann 2012).","Overfishing, especially where spawning aggregations are targeted, is a threat in parts of this species' range. There are no known major threats on a global-level at this time, but concerns for increasing fishing pressures on groupers such as this one could cause future declines (Sadovy de Mitchesonet al. in press 2017).","The species is not explicitly managed except in New Caledonia where aggregations are protected from fishing pressure during spawning season. The export of live fish by sea is banned in Malaysia and Indonesia. Trade in live fish is currently banned in the Philippines (A. Cabanban pers. comm.), but the exports of grouper (both live and dead) continue, although the importance of E. cyanopodus is not specifically known. In Australia, there isa 38 cm minimum size limit and a bag limit of five fish (Queensland, Australia Department of Primary Industries 2008). It occurs in marine protected areas within its range, including theGreat Barrier Reef Marine Park. Considering that fishing pressure is expected to increase for grouper species such as this one, improved population and fishery monitoring should be prioritized (Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. in press 2017).",This species is targeted by commercial and recreational fishers in parts of its range.

It can be common and abundant in parts of its range. It is taken in small-scale fisheries in parts of its range. Declines are suspected in a few areas due to fishing pressure, but this is not considered a major threat on a global-level at this time. Therefore, it is listed as Least Concern. Improved monitoring of exploited populations is needed and research on sub-populations as well as its reproductive biology would be beneficial.","This species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific from Port Alfred, South Africa; north to the Red Sea; east to the Pitcairn Islands Group (including Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Samoa and New Caledonia); north to southernJapan and Korea; and south to Australia (Northern Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, Great Barrier Reefand Lord Howe Island). Its distribution includes the islands of the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Seychelles, Comoros, Mauritius, Réunion).It may not occur in the Wallace and Futuna Islands. Its depth range is 4-160 metres.","This is one of the most widespread and common of all the grouper species. Up to six distinct sub-populations are suspected to exist. Declines are known to have occurred in some areas due to fishing pressure, but increases have also been detected in certain areas. This species appears to be able to replace other larger grouper species that are fished out.    Australia and South Pacific: Underwater surveys conducted on the Great Barrier Reef report this species asrare (~0.6 individuals per 1,000 m²; Pears 2005) or in low densities (0.22 to 0.89 fish/4,000 m²; Newman et al. 1997). This species had the 8th highest density out of 12 grouper species in French Polynesia, 10th out of 18 in Tonga and 6th out of 32 in New Caledonia, with highest overall densities at the latter locality. Its mean density in 4 American-affiliated islands and atolls (Table 8; Coral Reef Ecosystem Program Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center 2016) and in Australia (Reef Life Survey 2014) fluctuated, but remained stable in general from 2001-2016. A market survey conducted at the Honiara fish in the Solomon Islands from 2015-2016, reported this species to comprise 3% of the total groupers for sale and was ranked 13th by abundance with all individuals estimated to be mature (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data). In American Samoa, the estimated annual landings fluctuated between 15.8-45.5 kg from 1995-1998, peaked at 92.3 kg in 1999 and gradually declined to 3.4 kg by 2015, and during the same time period, its contribution to grouper landings declined from around 2% to less than 0.5% (NOAA 2016). Underwater surveys conducted in Hoga and Sampela, Indonesia in 2005 reported the overall density ofthis speciesas 1.5±0.8 per 1000 m<sup>2</sup>regardless of the area's level of protection from fishing pressure (Unsworthet al.2007). According to data from underwater surveys recorded in the Reef Life Survey, the density of this species fluctuated in Indonesia, but the density remained stable in general (Reef Life Survey 2014). According to the Directorate General of Capture Fisheries of Indonesia, catch fluctuated with an overall increasing trend from 2005-2014.  Northwest Pacific: This species is rare in Hong Kong (Sadovy and Cornish 2000), and is only occasionally seen in Taiwan (K-T. Shao pers. comm.). Underwater surveys conducted in Daya Bay, south China during May and September of 2015 and in Hong Kong in 2014-2016 did not record this species (To and Shea 2016, Shea and Ho 2016)<span lang='EN-IN'>. It was uncommonly observed during aHong Kong market survey for wild-caught groupers from 2004-2006 (0.3% of total wild-caught groupers; To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009).  Indian Ocean: This species can bevery common around dead coral blocks in seagrass beds in the Red Sea off southern Egypt (Lieske and Myers 2004). Underwater surveys conducted on shallow (2-14 metres) rocky reefs in northeastern Somalia did not record this species (Mann and Fielding 2000). It was also not reported from the North Kenya Banks in the late 1950s (Morgans 1964). It has been observed during shallow (less than 30 m depth) underwater surveys in southern Mozambique coral reefs between Ponta do Ouro and Inhaca (Robertson et al. 1996, Pereira 2003). Underwater shallowsurveys conducted in the St. Lucia and Maputaland Marine Reserves of northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 1987 and 1992 recorded five individuals of this species out of 43 groupers (Chater et al. 1995). It is considered to be abundant (~27 individuals per 1,000 m² of reef) in the Seychelles (Pears 2005). Only a few individuals of this species were recorded in linefish catches in the east African region by the mid 1970s (Nzioka 1977). It was relatively commonly recorded (8% of all groupers) in commercial line catches from southern Mozambique in the mid-1990s (Dengo and David 1993, van der Elst et al.1994). Subsequently (to 2005), its contribution to grouper catches fluctuated between 0 and 4% by number (D. Gove pers. comm.). It was not recorded in trap catches in central Mozambique from 1997-1998 (Abdula et al. 2000) and was not recorded from commercial line catches on rocky reefs of the central KwaZulu-Natalcoast from 2002 to 2006 (S. Fennessy unpublished data). Harmelin-Vivien and Bouchon (1976) reported it to be one of the most abundant serranids in southwest Madagascar at depths of 20 to 45 m, although commercial fishers report it to be very rare off Tamatave on the east coast (A. Pages pers. comm.). It is an important component of artisanal catches in Reunion Island and is a primary target of artisanal fishers in the Seychelles (Pittman 1996). It is also noted as particularly abundant on reefs in the Baie Ternay Marine Park and Brizarre Rock. This species also occurs to some level in artisanal catches in southern Kenya (Agembe et al. 2010). On the west coast of India, this species was recorded at only one out of nine shallow underwater survey sites (Sluka and Lazarus 2010). A market survey conducted in 2010-2011 at Kochi (Kerala), India suggested this species occurred in the landings “abundantly” (Bineeshet al.2014). In 2003-2004, this species was uncommon in the export trade from the Maldives for the live reef fish food trade, and it ranked 17th and 16th out of 17 in terms of quantity and value of the grouper species exported in 2010 (Sattar and Adams 2005, Marine Research Centre Maldives and Marine Conservation Society UK 2011, Sattar et al. 2011).",unknown,"This species inhabits outer coral reef slopes, and is less common, but can also inhabit rocky reefs. It occurs on mid-shelf reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (Newmanet al.1997, Pears 2005).In Seychelles, it was commonly seen resting in open rocky areas than in dense coral areas (Howlett et al. 2016). It also occurs in protected bays and lagoons and can be very common around dead coral blocks in seagrass beds in the Red Sea off southern Egypt (Lieske and Myers 2004). It primarily consumesfish and crustaceans (Morgans 1964, Harmein-Vivien and Bouchon 1976). The species is known to form spawning aggregations in Sabah, Malaysia (Daw 2004). Its maximum total length is 40 cm. It has a relatively fast growth rate and small size at maturity.It can attain sexual maturity at 12-16 cm standard length (Myers 1999, Sadovy and Cornish 2000). Its maximum reportedage is 19 years (Pears 2005) and 21 years (Mapleston et al. 2009). Studies conducted on the Great Barrier Reef suggest this species is a protogynous hermaphrodite with an age at sex transition of 9 years and total mortality of 0.38 year<sup>-1</sup>(Mapleston et al. 2009).","Coral reef degradation caused by destructive fishing practices, sediment run-off and bleaching events may impact this species. Fishing pressure could cause population declines for this species in some areas, especially fishing pressure in general is expected to increase in this region (e.g., Martosubroto 2005, Cunningham and Bodiguel 2006, Morgan 2006, Flewwelling and Hosch 2006). There are no known major threats impacting the species on a global-level at this time.","This species occurs throughout the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and there are size and bag limit restrictions for the recreational fishery in the state of Queensland, Australia.It also occurs in no take-areas in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique (Wells et al. 2007), although compliance is variable. In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, it occurs in a relatively large coastal marine protected area in which no demersal fishing is allowed, and is strictly enforced. This area is expected to be expanded in the near future into the southern Mozambique coast from Ponta d’Ouro to Maputo. In South Africa, a maximum of five individuals of this species may be retained by recreational fishers per day, but there are no limits for commercial fishers. In Mozambique, a maximum of 10 individuals of demersal species may be retained by recreational fishers. This species also occurs in numerous marine protected areas elsewhere in its range.",This relatively small grouper species is taken in small-scale reef fisheries within its range. It is sold in the live reef fish food trade (Lee and Sadovy 1998).

Spawning aggregations are heavily exploited by fisheries throughout its range, and it is exported from several countries to supply the live reef fish food and chilled fish trade. Due to overfishing, at least 42% of the 55 known aggregations have either declined in abundance or been extirpated over the past three decades. Fisheries catch data also provide supporting evidence that significant population declines have occurred in the Philippines, Indonesia, Micronesia, Palau, the Maldives and Fiji. Overfishing is likely occurring elsewhere in its range where large-scale grouper fisheries are present. There are conservation measures in place to protect spawning aggregations in many localities, but enforcement is considered insufficient to prevent poaching in most areas except Australia and Chagos. Therefore, this species is suspected to have declined on a global-level by at least 30% or more since the 1970s, which covers a period of mostly two generations in length (about 50 years), and this decline is expected to continue into the future over the next generation length (about 25 years). It is listed as Vulnerable A2bd+4bd. Improvements in fisheries monitoring and management are needed and spawning aggregation sites should be a high priority for conservation.The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific, along east Africa from Mozambique to the Red Sea, east to Samoa and the Phoenix Islands, north to Japan and south to Australia. It is not known from the Persian Gulf, Hawaii and French Polynesia. It is also recorded from Hibernia Reef in the Timor Sea south of Timor-Leste (B. Russell pers. comm. 2016) and Pratas Island (Dong Sha) in the South China Sea (P. Chan pers. comm. 2016). Its depth range is 1-70 metres.Spawning aggregations are known from the Seychelles, British Indian Ocean Territory, Kenya, Palau, Pohnpei (Micronesia), Melanesia (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Australia), Komodo National Park (Indonesia), Dumbea (New Caledonia) and Fiji.","This species is relatively uncommon and typically forms transient spawning aggregations during a few months of the year (Robinson et al. 2015). Outside of spawning season, this species is a minor component of fisheries catches. Significant population declines have occurred in areas where spawning aggregations have sustained heavy fishing pressure. Countries where aggregations have been fished to very low abundances include the following: Micronesia, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Maldives, Malaysia, Thailand, the Solomon Islands and Melanesia (including Palau and Fiji). A total of 55 aggregations have been documented for this species in the SCRFA database (<a href='https://www.scrfa.org/database/'>https://www.scrfa.org/database/</a> accessed November 2016, Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2016). According to data collected during underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted over the past three decades,19 of these aggregations have an unknown status (34%), 21 are declining (38%), two are extirpated (4%), three are increasing (5%), and 11 have remained unchanged (20%).The live reef fish food trade began in the 1990s and the steepest population declines occurred shortly after. Populations remain healthy on the Great Barrier Reef and Chagos Archipelago due to well-managed protected areas and restricted fishing on aggregations, but populations elsewhere have experienced severe declines. Therefore, the global population decline since the 1970s and 1990s is suspected to be at least 30%, and possibly as high as 50%, and is expected to continue into the future. Philippines: In <span style=''>the Philippines, there isanecdotal evidence that declines began shortly after the 1970s. According to national statistics in the Philippines, landings of this species were highly variable from 1999 to 2016, but have been declining sharply since 2013 (from 2,744 kg in 2013 to 140 kg in 2016; Santos and Barut 2017; Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material)<span style=''>. Hong Kong: Imports of this species by sea and air to Hong Kong for the live reef fish food trade increased from about 200 mt in 2000 to 1,400 mt in 2010 and declined thereafter to about 1,000 mt in 2016. An unknown percentage of these imports are sourced from hatchery-produced mariculture (mainly Taiwan, Indonesia and possibly China; Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. 2017; Figure 2 in the Supplementary Information). In recent years, imports of this species have predominantly originated from Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. Imports from Indonesia have declined notably since 2006, which could reflect declining populations there. Micronesia:<span style=''> <span style=''>Throughout Micronesia, spawning aggregation sizes have declined by at least 80%. This species was occasionallyobserved during an underwater survey conducted in 2005 in Pohnpei (Allen 2005). Underwater surveys conducted from 2001-2013 at a large spawning aggregation site in the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary reported continuous density declines from a high of approximately 125 individuals per 1,000 m² in 2005 to less than 25 individuals in 2013, which represents an 80% decline over 8 years(Rhodes et al. 2014). Since 2005, aggregations at Kehpara have been fished and have declined continuously since that time. A market survey conducted in Pohnpei in 2005 identified 98 individuals of this species, which represented 3.3% of the total catch. These individuals ranged in total length from 21.6 to 67 cm with an average of 39 cm, and 25% of females and 92% of males were immature (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). During a follow-up market survey in 2015-2016, 98 individuals were identified as this species, which represented 3.3% of the total catch and ranked 8th among the observed grouper species. These individuals ranged in total length from 30-70 cm with an average of 45.9 cm and 46% were immature (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodesunpub. data2016).A fishery survey conducted in Chuuk in 2014recorded that this species represented 0.8% of total landings, with 85% taken by spear and 15% by hook and line, the average total length was 55.4 cm with a range from 30 to 90 cm and about 45% were immature (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).<span style=''>There have been illegal activities reported in Chuuk of foreign vessels taking groupers for the live reef food fish trade for export, although there is no information on volumes (C. Graham pers. comm. 2016). Solomon Islands: An underwater survey conducted in 2006 in the Solomon Islands occasionally recorded this species at depths from 3 to 60 m. In the Solomon Islands, aggregations are known from Njari and Kennedy Islands and Munda (Roviana Lagoon) in Western Province, and others have been anecdotally reported from a wide number of localities (Hamiltonet al. 2003). At Njari, aggregation densities were up to 25 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>in 2009-2011 (Hugheset al. 2011). Little is known on the Kennedy Island aggregation, and aggregationsat Roviana recorded a maximum abundance of 700 individuals, with densities around 25 individuals per 100 m², which is similar to other locales examined (Hamiltonet al.2012).A marketsurvey conducted in Honiara in 2015-2016, observed 94 individuals of this species, which represent 2% of the total catch and ranked 16th amongst grouper species. These individuals ranged in total length from 19 to 85 cm with an average of 48.1 cm and 33% were immature (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpub. data). Palau: Fisher interviews conducted in Palau in 1960-2003 recorded decadal declines in grouper catch, which includedEpinephelus fuscoguttatus,E. polyphekadionandPlectropomus areolatus(Palau Conservation Society and SCRFA 2010). Known and suspected spawning aggregations of this species were identified through anecdotal fisher interviews at six sites in Palau. Hundreds of individuals of this species have been observed at two aggregation sites in Palau in recent years. A fish market survey conducted in August 2010 (during spawning season) recorded relatively low numbers of this species(n=39) with a mean total length of only 33 cm, which is likely indicative that declines had occurred due to overfishing (PCS and SCRFA 2011). At three Palau aggregation sites, interannual variations in abundance were observed from 1994-1996, with peaks of around 300-349 fish at Ngerumkaol in all years, peaks at Ebiil in 1995 of 205 fish and 337 fish in 1996 and peaks at Western Entrance of less than 185 fish in 1995 and 137 fish in 1996 (Johanneset al.1999). In 2009, surveys reported the Ebiil aggregation size was similar to that in 1996 (Palau Conservation Society and SCRFA 2010). Papua New Guinea: Aggregation size in Papua New Guinea ranged from 32 to 153 individuals from 2005 to 2006 (Robinson et al. 2015). A creel survey conducted in Kavieng and Dyaul Islands recorded that this species contributed to 4% of the total weight of spear and line catches and total lengths ranged from 19.5 to 50.8 cm (Waldie et al. 2016). Kenya: Underwater surveys and fisher interviews conducted in Kenya's Diani-Chale Marine Reserve confirmed the existence of a spawning aggregation site there(Samoilys et al. 2014).A fisheries survey recorded 23 individuals of this species (3.7% of the total catch)in southern Kenya (Simoni, Vanga and Msambweni) and a single individual (&lt; 0.1% of the total catch) at southern and northern landing sites (Agembe et al. 2010). India: In the southwest India seamount fishery, this was an abundant species in the catch, and ranged in total length from 46 to 86 cm (Bineesh et al. 2014). Australia (Great Barrier Reef): During an experimental line fishing survey, 577 individuals of this species were captured and ranged in total length from 25 to 95 cm and ranged in age from 1 to 42 years (Mapleston et al. 2009). This species represents 1.2% of the total commercial catch (Pears et al. 2007). Indonesia: Underwater surveys conductedto about 30 m depthat 19 reef sites across Indonesia from 2004-2013 recorded very few individuals of this species (COREMAP database, Indonesian Government). From 2004-2013 there was a reduction in numbers of aggregating individuals of this species despite limited protection initiated in 2001, and both sites are still heavily fished by local artisanal fishers (Pet et al. 2005). This is one of the top 6 species exported from Indonesia for the live fish export trade, although in relatively small volumes (about 12 tonnes wild-caught in 2015). According to export data, 87% of the individuals of this species were below the size of sexual maturation (M. Chazanah pers. comm. 2017). Maldives: The live reef food fish trade began in the Maldives in 1993, and at that time, this species was rare on reef slope, reef crest and shallow lagoon areasat North Malé and Thaa Atoll (Sluka and Reichenbach 1996). By 1997, mean size had declined, but density remained the same (Sluka 1997). In 2010, Fishwatch surveys conducted at North Huvadhu, Baa, North Malé and Haa Alifu recorded low densities and biomass of this species (&lt;1 individual per 500 m² or 0.157 g/m²). According to fisher interviews and quantitative surveys, all grouper species experienced population declines in the Maldives (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011).This species was the most highly ranked grouper in terms of quantity and value among live exports in 2010, and ranked 12th and 6th among groupers in chilled exported groupers. In 2010, the capture method was primarily spearfishing on snorkel (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain E. fuscoguttatus from traders for scientific study due to its high-value and declining catch (V. Evans and S. Hashim pers. comm. 2017). Larger fish may now be exported frozen, a practice that is relatively new and may be associated with declines in preferred market-size individuals. A clear decline in catch-per-unit-effort for all groupers was noted from 1995 to 2002 and similar declines were observed in exported volumes from 1995 to 2004, along with a general decrease in value (Sattar and Adams 2005).Live grouper export volumes peaked around 1996 at &gt;500 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>and declined thereafter to about 125 mt in 2010 (Sattar et al. 2011; Figure 3 in the Supplementary Information).According to grouper fishers in the Maldives, large quantities of this species as well as larger sized individuals of E. fuscoguttatus and Plectropomus species could no longer be found by 2010 and about 90% of exported individuals of this species are now juveniles with sizes much reduced compared to 2003 (Sattar et al. 2011). In August 2011, there were seven main export companies operating, up from three in 2003-2006 (Sattar et al. 2011). The volume of chilled groupers increased and was higher in 2010 (approximately 450 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>) relative to the lowest recorded volumes in 2004 (125 mt yr<sup>-1</sup>). In addition, the mean total length declined from about 68 cm in the unexploited stocks (1987-1991) to less than 45 cm in 2003 and to 35 cm in 2010-2011, and 96% of individuals were immature (Sattar et al. 2011, Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). Fiji: Surveys conducted on aspawning aggregationin Kadavu, Naiqoro Passage in 2009-2011 recordeda maximum of about 130 individualsover the three years of spawning seasons; however,local fishers reported that this aggregation was much larger in the past, and that poaching occurs at night (Sadovy de Mitcheson2011). Grouper aggregations, including this species, form in northern Vanua Levu outer reef passages and are intensively fished to supply both local and international markets, and in 2015, the total estimated grouper catchwas in excess of 20 mt, which is considered unsustainable. In the past, catches larger than that were also taken from Bua when the live reef food fish trade was targeting aggregations for export. The Mali Passage aggregation is also no longer considered productive after protracted fishing at that site. Much of the current fishery appears to be illegal, unregulated and unmonitored and is heavily reliant on both night-time and SCUBA spearfishing. Catch-per-unit-effort also declined substantially in just 10 years. Due to overfishing, this species is also now uncommon in the local markets despite its continued high-value (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015). Multiple sites (Pacific): The species typically represents less than 5% of the total catch in local markets in the Pacific Islands (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data). Some international trade occurs between Pacific Island countries to Southeast Asia as part of the live reef food fish trade. During underwater surveys conducted across 17 Pacific Island localities in 2002-2009, this species was only rarely observed at eight of them (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu), and was not observed in the other sites, including the Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Tonga and Wallis and Futuna. Overall, only 25 individuals of this species were observed out of 7,578 groupers (Pacific Procfish Database 2002-2009); however, the species may have been missed during surveys since it is typically not as visible to divers except during spawning aggregation season. Western Indian Ocean: Underwater surveys conducted in the Western Indian Ocean, including in Mozambique, Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar, Chagos and Djibouti, reported this species in low densities, including in Chagos which is ostensibly protected from fishing (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016). These data indicate that the species occurs in low densities except when forming spawning aggregations (Chagos: 0.019 fish/250 m² in 2014; Mozambique: 0.018 fish/250 m² in 2010-2011; Tanzania: 0.11 fish/250 m² in 2009 and 0.22 fish/250 m² in 2011;Djibouti: 0.057 fish/250 m² in 2014).The mean number of individuals of this species in the Kenyan spawning aggregation site was 7.6 fish/1,000 m²,which is 4 to 10 fold less than aggregations in the Solomon Islands, Palau, Micronesia and the Seychelles (Samoilys et al. 2015). In the Seychelles (Farquhar Atoll) spawning aggregation size peaked at 1,050 individuals in January 2004 and January 2005 (Robinson et al. 2008).",decreasing,"Adults of this species inhabit lagoon pinnacles, patch reefs, channels and outer reef slopes in clearwater, coral-rich areas. Juveniles inhabit seagrass beds and estuarine or low salinity inshore areas. Its maximum total length is 120 cm. It utilizes migratory corridors to reach spawning aggregation sites (a travel distance of up to 25 km), and males tend to arrive prior to females. Spawning aggregationsare typically formed in channels, patch reefs and outer reef pinnacles at depths from 3 to greater than 70 m in areas ranging in size from 16 to 175 km² (Rhodes et al. 2012, Rhodes et al. 2013, Waldie et al. 2016). Aggregations tend to form consistently relative to specific lunar cycles (several each year), with individuals resident at the site for up to 14 days (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Rhodes et al. 2012).Spawning aggregation sites are known from the Seychelles(Bijoux et al. 2013), British Indian Ocean Territory, Kenya, Palau (Western Channel, Ebiil and Ulong), Pohnpei (Micronesia), Melanesia (Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands), outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Australia), Komodo National Park (Indonesia), Dumbea (New Caledonia) and Fiji.In Australia, the size at 50% sexual maturity for females is 57 cm fork length and about 9 years of age, with a maximum reported age of 42 years (Pears et al. 2006, Mapleston et al. 2009). <span style=''>Based on a longevity of 42 years, age of first maturity of 9 years,and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynskiand Bellwood(2006)<span style=''>, one generation length is estimated to be 25.5 years.",Heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations and take of juveniles from wild stocks for aquaculture grow-out are major threats to this species. Secondary threats include the degradation of seagrass beds and coral reefs due to coastal development and climate change (Burke et al. 2002).,"Studies have shown that protected areas have densities of this species that are around 10-fold higher as compared to non-protected areas (M. Samoilys unpublished data, K. Rhodes pers. comm., Pears unpub. thesis).The Pohnpei State Government began implementing measures in the 1980s to reduce fishing effort on groupers, including a partial sales ban during the spawning season (March to April), but subsistence fishing on aggregations continued during the closed season. In 1995, the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary was established, but the spawning aggregation site of this species was excluded, so fishing continued. Spawning aggregation sites in Ant Channel (Ant Atoll) and Palikir Pass (unconfirmed) have also been protected under the state sanctuary act; however, only the Ant site is enforced. A catch size limit was also instituted, but is also not enforced.In Chuuk, Micronesia, a ban on the catch, sale or export of groupers occurs annually from 1 January to 31 May.In Manus Province, Papua New Guinea, reef dynamiting and night spearfishing on spawning aggregations are prohibited; however, some young fishermen ignore the night spearfishing ban. In Buka Island, the power of community leaders to enforce closures within their respective communities appears to have declined considerably in recent years (Hamilton 2003), but regulations are being developed for this and other species that would include minimum sizes and seasonal protection (R. Hamilton pers. comm. 2017). In Komodo Marine Park, Indonesia, there are spawning aggregation protected zones, and despite a monitoring and enforcement lapse in 2004 and 2005 which resulted in abundance declines, this species steadily increased from 2006 to 2009 at one site, while a second site continued to decline (Mangubhai et al. 2013). In Australia, there are minimum catch size and bag limits for this species as well as a commercial catch quota according to the Queensland Coral Reef Fin Fish Management Plan. In Honiara in the Solomon Islands, a management plan for the live reef fish trade was drafted in 2001-2002 that intended to ban aggregation fishing for five days on either side of the new moon during the three months of the year when aggregations are known to form (Donnelly 2001, Oreihaka pers. comm. 2003). At the time of this assessment, the Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources has yet to act on this ban. The Solomon Islands government rewrote the Fisheries Act in 2016 and is currently developing national level regulations, including management measures for this and several grouper species (R. Hamilton pers. comm. 2017). In Palau, the Marine Protection Act of 1994 prohibited the sale of this species from April 1 through July 31 each year, which is intended to protect spawning aggregations. In 1995, this was amended to prohibit any capture even for subsistence during the closed period (Johannes et al. 1999). A four-month ‘bul’ (taboo) was enforced in the state of Ngeremlengui, but was not completely effective in preventing fishing on the spawning aggregation (Johannes 1999). Recently, the ban was extended from 1 April to 31 October and a 3-year ban commenced in July 2015 (to July 2018) in Ngarchelong and Kayangel States. In Malaysia, marine parks were established under the Fisheries Act of 1985 for the protection of breeding grounds and habitat of aquatic life, which may provide some protection for this species. In the Seychelles, a live reef fish ban was put in place in 2005 (Aumeeruddy and Robinson 2006). Several marine protected areas are established in the Maldives, but they occur over only a small portion of the total reef area and all are poorly enforced, and there is no official management plan in place for the grouper fishery (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). Catch size limits for this species were introduced in March of 2014 (Sattar et al. 2014).","This species is commonly targeted by spear and hook-and-line fisheries.It is caught incidentally in multi-species artisanal and small-scale local fisheries and targeted by commercial export fisheries for the internationalSoutheast Asian live reef fish foodtrade.It is a component of the Chuuk (Micronesia) export trade to Guam and Hawaii. It is also exported for the chilled fish trade from Fiji and the Maldives, and the value of chilled grouper exports, at least in China, appears to be increasing.Individuals are also taken from the wild for grow-out in aquaculture ventures. It is one of the most commonly cultured species (by hatchery) and also now heavily traded in hybrid form as the Sabah Grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x E. lanceolatus), which is a combination said to be fast-growing and with good flesh."

It is highly-valued by both recreational and commercial fisheries, especially in the live reef fish food trade based in Hong Kong. Wild sources for this trade are mostly sourced from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. It is under specific protection in the following countries: Australia, Mozambique, South Africa, Andaman Islands (India) and American Samoa. Both quantitative population data and life history data are lacking for this species. The estimated generation length of Epinephelus itajara, which is 21.5 years, is applied as a proxy. Being such a large predator, it is rare even in areas unexploited by fishing and it has nearly been extirpated in some areas where it has been heavily fished. Serious declines are known to have occurred in Hong Kong and the Philippines, but the data are largely anecdotal and not quantitative; in Zanzibar, where there are quantitative data, the decline is over a time period well below three generations. Localised declines may be a consequence of focused local fishing activity and further pressures are likely to be placed on this species in other parts of its range as traditional sources decline. According to records of imports into the Hong Kong market between 2002 to 2015, imports of this species have been increasing dramatically since about 2013, but it is not known if this trend is due to the increase in hatchery production in Taiwan, Indonesia and mainland China (i.e., not sourced from the wild). Due to intrinsic biological characteristics, including forming spawning aggregations, this species is highly susceptible to declines under heavy fishing pressure. Global-level declines may be occurring, but long-term quantitative data are not available across a large portion of its range. Therefore, it is listed as Data Deficient. Action is needed to reduce fishing effort and acquire data on population trends, life history and reproductive biology. The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species is distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region from Algoa Bay (South Africa) to the Red Sea east to Japan, mainland China, Hainan Island, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Micronesia and the Hawaiian and Pitcairn Islands (Myers 1991, Heemstra and Randall 1993), north to southern Japan and south to Australia. In Australia, it occurs along tropical and warm temperate coasts, rarely straying into cool temperate waters (Gomon et al. 1994). It is absent from the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (Heemstra and Randall 1993), but is reported from the coast of Pakistan near the entrance to the Gulf of Oman, and has been observed by divers off Raysut in southern Oman (Randall 1995).There is also a record for Hong Kong (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). It has also been reported from northeastern New Zealand (Roberts et al. 2015). Its depth range is one to 100 metres.","Epinephelus lanceolatusis the largest and most widely distributed of all the grouper species (Sadovy and Cornish 2000), but is naturally rare in much of its range even in unexploited areas(Randall 1995)and has been nearlyextirpated in areas where it has been heavily fished (Lieske and Myers 1994). It has all but disappearedin several localities due primarily to spearfishermen, and it requires a lengthy recovery time(Myers 1991).Population decline may be occurring at the global level, but quantitative data are lacking in a large portion of its range.It can be found in the entire Indian Ocean, but is rarely seen north of the Maldives (Debelius 1993). It is relatively common in the Andaman Sea in protected areas. It is relatively uncommon in Taiwan (Kuo and Shao 1999). During about 4,400 underwater survey conducted in the Western Indian Ocean (Comoros, Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, Chagos - British Indian Ocean Territories) from 2009 to 2014, not a single individual of this species was observed (M. Samoilys unpublished data). Surveys conducted in 2015-2016 in Iles Glorieuses (French Scattered Islands) and northern Kenya, one individual was observed in each location, and several individuals were observed at the remote Farquhar Atoll in the Seychelles (Friedlander et al. 2014). There are only seven records of this species out of more than 15,000 serranid observations in the global Reef Life Survey database (http://reeflifesurvey.imas.utas.edu.au/portal/search - accessed October 2014). This species is incidentally caught in fisheries in Pohnpei and it is naturally rare there (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016).Recreational divers in subtropical eastern Australia report that large adults of this species have virtually disappeared from reefs where they previously had been seen (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2016). In Queensland, this species is protected and still commonly seen (H. Choat pers. comm. 2016). This species has been described as commonly exported from the Maldives, especially to Hong Kong by Sattar and Adams (2005), but export records from 2003 to 2010 record this species as virtually negligible in grouper exports (Sattar et al. 2011). An aggregation of this species that forms off Unguja Island in Zanzibar has been fished since the 1970s, and landings have declined despite improved fishing gear (interviewed fishers reported declines from around 6-8 fish per day per vessel over 20 years ago to 1-2 fish per day per vessel in 2010; Samoilyset al. 2013). This is estimated to represent a decline of about 45% over 21 years or a 31% decline over 30 years. Fisher interviews conducted in several localities in the Philippines indicated that the species has not been seen in catches since the 1990s, and from the 1950s to 2014, catch declined by about 74% (Lavideset al.2009, 2016), which represents a 35% decline over the past three generation lengths. This species was commonly seen on shallow reefs in the Philippines in the 1970's, but is now almost totally absent in most parts of the Philippines except in Palawan where large individuals are still occasionally observed. It is currently very rare in fish markets of the Philippines, and only juveniles have been recently recorded (K. Carpenter pers. comm. 2016).

It tends to be solitary and inhabits lagoon and seaward reefs, including rocky areas as well as coral. Large individuals often have a 'home' in which they frequently stay (Myers 1991) and can be found in shallow inshore waters, including rocky areas, caves and wrecks, harbours and estuaries (Lau and Li 2000, Sadovy and Cornish 2000). It can occur as deep as 100 metres, but is typically found in shallower waters (Heemstra and Randall 1993). It has also been taken from brackish estuarine areas (Debelius 1993, Heemstra and Randall 1993). Occasional large (ca. 150 cm total length) specimens have been caught in waters shallower than 50 metres by prawn trawlers operating in turbid water over muddy substrata (S. Fennessy pers. obs.). It consumes spiny lobsters and a variety of fishes (Clua et al. 2011). It has high home reef residency, and travels annually from its home reef to spawning aggregation sites (Cluaet al. 2015).Size at first maturity is thought to be approximately 129 cm and maximum size is 270 cm (Lau and Li 2000). It rarely reaches its maximum weight of about 400 kg.There are few verified direct observations of spawning aggregations. A seasonal spawning aggregation site has been confirmed offsouthern Zanzibar (Samoilys et al. 2013), New Caledonia (Clua et al. 2015), the Maldives (Tamelander et al. 2008) and Papua New Guinea (although only 2-3 individuals were involved; Hamilton et al. 2004). Aggregations also likely occur in southwestern Papua (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2016), eastern Indonesia(Sadovy and Liu 2004), the Solomon Islands (Hamilton et al. 2005) and Vanuatu(Samoilys et al. 2013). Natural mortality has been estimated at 0.2 (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2016). The lack of life history data on this species prevents estimation of generation length; however, Epinephelus itajara is considered an appropriate proxy to use for generation length based on similarities in size and ecology to E. lanceolatus. Therefore, based on a longevity of 37 years, age of first maturity of six years<span style=''>(Bullock et al. 1992), and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynskiand Bellwood(2006), one generation length is estimated to be 21.5 years.","Overfishing is a major threat to this species (Pogonoski et al. 2002, Lavides et al. 2016). Localised depletions may be a consequence of focused local fishing activity and further pressures are likely to be placed on this species in other parts of its range (e.g., Australia or other Southeast Asian countries) once Indonesian populations are reduced (Pogonoskiet al. 2002).","This species is under widespread protection where it occurs in Australia. Recreational fishers are not permitted to take this species in Queensland, Australia (http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/fishweb/). InNorthern Territory, Australia, no species in the genus Epinepheluslarger than 120 cm may be taken (Pogonoski et al. 2002). It has been a 'Protected Species' in Western Australia, New South Wales since 1977 and in Queensland since 2003. It is also protected in a number of Australian marine parks, including the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Ningaloo Marine Park.Take of thisspecies in South Africa has been prohibited since 1992. It has also been prohibited in Mozambique since 2003, but compliance has likely been poor. It has been protected in American Samoa since 2012 (Fenner 2014). It is protected under the Wildlife Act in New Zealand. There is a total ban on the capture and sale ofE. lanceolatusin the Andaman Islands, India, though some incidental catch does occur (R. Nair pers. comm. 2016). Conservation measures are not known elsewhere in its range. If hatchery production constitutes a significant proportion of the market and replaces wild-caught fish, the threat to the wild population may be alleviated. However wild fish are still taken and are also needed for broodstock; reports of large individuals (too old to grow out in captivity) taken from the wild, are still coming in from Indonesia (e.g., P. Chan and D. Trakakispers. comm. 2002).Research is needed on age, growth, reproduction and fisheries monitoring is required.","This species is highly esteemed and valued for food and is exploited in both commercial and recreational fisheries. The gall bladder, stomach and skin are used in traditional Chinese medicine. It is often kept for extended periods in the visible tanks of seafood restaurants to attract interest and buyers (Y. Sadovy pers. obs. 2016). Retail prices were as high as USD  169/kg during the late 1990s for small sized individuals, which are more highly preferred by the restaurant sector in Hong Kong than larger fish (Sadovy and Vincent 2002). Interview surveys in Hong Kong found that 46% of interviewed seafood restaurants (n = 166) soldE. lanceolatus(Lau and Parry-Jones 1999). It is generally caught with hook and line or spear (Heemstra and Randall 1993) and was much sought after by line and spear-fishers in New South Wales (Australia) and South Africa prior to its listing as a protected species in these countries in the early 1980s and 1992.It is utilized both wild-caught and in mariculture. It can be hatchery produced for growout but juveniles are still also taken from the wild mainly for the live reef food-fish trade, which is centred in Hong Kong, but also involved heavily with mainland China. International trade in this species into Hong Kong has grown dramatically since about 2013/2014 (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information). Indonesia and the Philippines were, respectively, the main sources of live reef food fish imports in general into Hong Kong, as well as being the main sources forEpinephelus lanceolatus(Lau and Parry-Jones 1999, Sadovy et al. 2003). Hong Kong government data suggests that Indonesia is the only country of origin, but interviews with traders revealed other source countries were likely, including the Philippines, Australia, Malaysia, India (Andaman Islands) and Thailand (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999, C.M. James pers. comm. 2016).In the past one to two decades, this species has been very successfully produced by mariculture in Taiwan, Indonesia and mainland China. From 2002-2015, annual imports of this species steeply increasedinto Hong Kong by ship and by plane (supplementary material). Some fish are from the wild and some from mariculture; further, the most commonly sold fish by far in Hong Kong’s retail sector currently is a E. lanceolatus/E. fuscoguttatus hybrid – so the recent increases in imports may reflect this, rather than E. lanceolatus per se (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2016). Juveniles are sometimes found in the pet (aquarium) trade."

A substantial proportion of catch includes age groups that have just matured and are about to achieve their full growth potential, indicating that fishery may at least be fully exploited. Mortality caused by fishery is lower than the natural rate of mortality, but more than half of natural mortality, suggesting considerable impact from fishing.

Only 81 out of &gt; 31,000 grouper individuals observed in underwater surveys in the NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Programme were identified as this species. Similarly, 19 out of almost 16,000 grouper individuals were identified as this species from 2002 to 2009 on Pacific shallow reefs (Pacific Regional Oceanic and Coastal Fisheries Development Programme The Pacific Community). It also represented only seven individuals out of &gt; 21,000 global-level underwater survey observations of epinepheline serranids (Global Reef Life Survey databaseaccessed October 2014). An underwater survey conductedin the Pacific reported that densities varied considerably between islands. For example, New Caledonia recorded 138 fish/km² of reef, Fiji 8 fish/km², Tonga 50 fish/km² and the Great Barrier Reef 10 fish/km² (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008). It comprised &lt; 0.2% of the total commercial landings (of which groupers comprise ~24%) during a 12-month market survey conducted in Chuuk, Micronesia (J. Cuetos-Beno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data). This species comprised 2% by number and 0.5% by weight of an experimental catch study of groupers in New Caledonia (Kulbickiet al.2000). Pears (2005) reported very low densities on the Great Barrier Reef (&lt;0.01 fish/1,000 m<sup>2</sup>) and in the Seychelles (0.3 fish/1,000 m<sup>2</sup>). It comprised a negligible amount of the catch in the Maldives grouper fishery in 2003, and &lt; 1% in 2010 (Sattaret al.2011). It was also one of the least abundant groupers observed during an underwater survey conducted on east South African coral reefs (Floros 2010). During a study conducted by Mann (2016) from 2001 to 2013 in the iSimangaliso World Heritage Site of eastern South Africa, it comprised 2% of all groupers caught from the shore on hook and line (n=31 out of 1,414 groupers; 0.2% of all fish caught).

Its depth range is 2-100 metres (Allen and Erdmann 2012).","This speciesis moderately common. There may be some localised declines, but none on a global-scale. Underwater surveys conducted on the Great Barrier Reef indicate very low natural abundances of this species with evidence of restriction to northern reefs (Pears 2005). Experimental linefishing conducted on the Great Barrier Reef recorded 178 individuals of this species with total lengths ranging from 22.6-44.8 cm and ages ranging from 1-7 years (Mapleston et al. 2009). During experimental fishing conducted in New Caledonia, this species comprised 24% by number and 16% by weight of all serranids caught. Catches in 1987 were approximately twice as high as in 2000, and average weight changed from 1.1 to 0.9 kg per fish for the same levels of fishing effort suggesting possible decline (M. Kulbicki unpublished data 2016).The Philippines government reported that catches of this species from 1999-2016 varied annually from 0-50 metric tonnes until 2013, increased sharply in 2014 and 2015 to 1,739 and 2,345 mt respectively, and then declined to 713 mt in 2016 (Santos et al. 2017). In Pohnpei, Micronesia, 35 individuals of this species were observed in the coral reef fishery over a five-month survey period, for a total of 1.9% of the total serranid catch and a size range of 18.5 to 34.5 cm total length (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). In 2015, a total of 5 individuals were observed over a 12-month survey period, which represented 0.2% of the total Pohnpei epinephelid catch (K. Rhodes and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016). In Chuuk, Micronesia, this species was not among the top 50 fish species observed during a 12-month market survey in 2014, the mean total length among individuals was 34.6 cm and it represented 0.2% of all individuals landed (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).During widespread shallow water (3-5 m inner lagoon; 8-10 m outer reef) stationary point count surveys in the Federated States of Micronesia, Marianas Islands and the Marshall Islands, only 4 individuals (35-37.5 cm TL; 0.62 kg average weight) of this species were observed (Majuro, Marshall Islands). No fish were observed in Chuuk, Pohnpei, Yap or Rongelap of the Marshall Islands (Houk unpublished data 2016). In a market survey conducted in Honiara in the Solomon Islands, this species comprised 5% of the total groupers, individuals ranged in size from 21-48 cm total length and it represented the 7th most abundant grouper in fish sales (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data 2016).",decreasing,"This species inhabits coastal and offshore coral and rocky reefs often on open sand at the base of reef (Allen and Erdmann 2012). Juveniles are found in shallow coral rubble. Its maximum total length is 60 cm. It primarily consumes small fish, crabs and octopi (Heemstra and Randall 1993). This species is known to conduct inter-reefal movements of at least 5 to 10 km. This is a relativelyfast-growing serranid species with a high population turnover rate. A specimen of total length 43.1 cm was found to be 7 years of age. In Chuuk, Micronesia, longevity is 13 years and age at first maturity for females is 2.8 years and 4 years for males (Rhodeset al. 2016). When applying an age at first reproduction of 3 years and longevity of 13 years, its estimated generation length is 8 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2. There are anecdotal reports of spawning aggregation formation from Papua New Guinea and Pohnpei (K. Rhodes pers. comm.).","Fishing may be causing localised declines in areas with intensive reef fisheries, but this is not considered a major threat on a global-level at this time.","There are some seasonal fishing bans within its range, such as in Pohnpei from 1 March-30 April (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016), catch and sales bans in Palau from 1 May-30 September (S. Victor pers. comm. 2016) and sales, catch and export bans in Chuuk from 1 January-31 May (C. Graham pers. comm. 2016). It occurs in marine protected areas within its range. Identification or confirmation of spawning behaviour, specifically whether the species aggregates to spawn is needed. Some additional studies of its reproductive life history are required to define its sexual pattern. Further information and monitoring of its presence in the valuable live reef food fish trade is needed.","This species is taken in artisanal and subsistence fisheries, but is generally not directly targeted or as desirable as some other grouper species.

It ranked 14 and 15 out of 17 in terms of quantity and value of grouper species exported from the Maldives in 2010 (Marine Research Centre Maldives and Marine Conservation Society 2011). It was not recorded as a commonly exported species from the Maldives in 2003-2004 (Sattar and Adams 2005), and remained in low abundance during a fisheries catch survey in 2010 (Sattar et al. 2011). This species only occasionally occurred in 10-15 years of underwater observation and market surveys conducted at a very limited locality in Taiwan (K-T. Shao pers. comm. 2016).

Its entire life is generally restricted to a relatively small range within its home reef (To 2009, Clements et al. 2012). Its maximum total length is 32 cm (Heemstra and Randall 1993). It primarily consumes fish and crustaceans. It is aprotogynous hermaphrodite.Males were larger than females in Reunion and sex change occurred at 3 to 5 years of age (Pothin et al. 2004).

It is also found in northwestern Australia and Indonesia (Aru, Kei, and Tanimbar Islands). Its depth range is 10-110 metres (Allen and Erdmann 2012).","Thisis considered to be a common species throughout its range (Craiget al.2011), though can be relatively uncommon in some areas.Ithas three geographically separated sub-populations based on differences in colour pattern and scale counts: 1. Western Indian Ocean;2. Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman; 3. northwestern Australia and Indonesia. Species-specific population information is limited in some areas and some landings are unreported (Jacquet et al. 2010, FAO 2016). There are some indications of declines in parts of its range due to overfishing, including in the Seychelles (declining catch rates up to 50%), Kuwait, Saudi Arabia (Persian Gulf), Reunion and the Rodrigues Islands, but overall, the species is unlikely to have declined more than 30% over its global range (Bunce et al. 2008, Pistorius and Taylor 2009, Al-Zaidan et al. 2013, FAO 2016).  Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman: Species-specific landings were first reported to FAO by Saudi Arabia (Persian Gulf) in the early 2000s with 1,100 tonnes in 2001 and from 2002-2010 average landings were around 400 tonnes per year, increased in 2011 and 2012 to more than 1,000 tonnes and declined thereafter to 49 tonnes in 2014 (FAO 2016). This represents a 96% decline over a 13 year time period. In Kuwait, it is targeted by the artisanal fishery, where fishery production doubled between 1980 and mid-2000s and is expected to continue increasing (Al-Zaidan et al. 2016). In 2004-2005, Kuwait's local gargoor trap fishery landed 13.4 kg ofEpinephelus multinotatus, which comprised 0.17% of the total catch by weight (Chenet al.2012). Aggregate grouper landings reported from Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain over the past 24 years show no clear trend (FAO 2013). From 2004-2008, landings of this speciesin Bahrain were 0.5 metric tonnes in 2004 and 0.3 mt in 2008, and from 2009-2012, no landings of this species were recorded (E. Abdulqader pers. comm. 2013). From 1979-2012, landings of this speciesin Kuwait fluctuated with 186 mt harvested in 1979 and 2,059 mt in 2012, with a peak of 5,355 mt in 1986 (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013). Deeper-water groupers of large size are extensively fished in Oman and the Arabian Sea both by line fishing and trawling, and concerns have been raised that this assemblage is subject to high levels of fishing in Oman (J. McIlwain unpublished data). Aggregate fisheries catch statistics for groupers indicate a 43% decline over a range of 3-11 years and effort is likely to increase over the next 10-15 years in the region.   Western Australia: Genetically different stocks are considered in Shark Bay, Ningaloo, Pilbara and Broome in Western Australia, which supports the current approach of four separate fisheries management plans for this species there (Stephensonet al.2001). Landings of this species in Australia averaged about 120 tonnes/year from 2000-2010 with no clear trend (Zeller and Pauly 2015). It is taken in commercial multispecies demersal trawl fisheries in Pilbara and by trap and line fisheries in Broome and is considered the most heavily fished grouper species in Western Australia(Stephenson<span class='apple-converted-space'>et al. 2001).<span class='apple-converted-space'>  Western Indian Ocean: During shallow underwater surveys conducted from 2009-2015in 6 countries (Tanzania, northern Mozambique, northeastern Madagascar, Comoros, Chagos and Isles Glorieuses) only one individual of this species was observedin Chagos. Additional surveys found 2 individuals – one in northern Kenya and one in northeastern Madagascar (M. Samoilys unpublished data). This suggests that this species is rare or does not typically occur on shallow reefs. It is possibly naturally uncommon in mainland East Africa as it was not observed in underwater surveys (to ~20 m depth) along the Kenyan coast in the past (Samoilys 1988), or in southern Tanzania’s Mnazi Bay Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park (Obura 2004), though this may be a reflection of its deeper depth preferences. This specieswas relatively abundant in the Seychelles and was the most common of the three grouper species taken in demersal handline fisheries there (Mees 1992, MRAG 1996). Densities in shallow (less than 20 metres depth) in the Seychelles ranged from 0 to 0.51 fish/1,000 m², with higher densities found in the Amirantes Isles (Pears 2005). Its population in the Seychelles was overfished by at least 2007 (J. Robinson pers. comm. 2007). Fishing activity on spawning aggregations in the Seychelles can yield between 400 and 8,000 kg in a single fishing trip (Robinsonet al.2007). A 61% decline in catch per unit effort over a ten year period (1996-2007) was documented in Aldabra’s marine protected area (Seychelles) based on landings from a small subsistence fishery and the decline is thought to be caused mainly by reef degradation (Pistorius and Taylor 2009). In 2009, catch in the hook and line fishery of the Seychelles totaled 2.2 tonnes (WIOfish 2016).This species is one of the 19 grouper speciestaken in the small-scale artisanal fishery around Réunion and estimated total catches declined from about 20 to 45 mt from 1998 to 2002, and further to 3 mt in 2004-2005, and no effort data are available (D. Miossec pers. comm. 2007). According to fishermen in the Rodrigues Islands, this species reportedly declined by number and body size over the past 25 years (Bunce et al. 2008). Very limited deeper (30 m) fisheries occur in East Africa, though hook and line, seine, traps and trawl are listed for taking groupers in Tanzanian waters. Some illegal foreign fishing vessels trawling the shelf area beyond territorial waters may be taking this species (Samoilys 2004).It is reported fromcatches in 2000, 2002 and 2003 of the commercial hook and line fishery of Mozambique (S. Fennessy pers. comm. 2007). The relative abundance of this species in artisanal fisheries in southern Kenya was low (1-5% of grouper catch (Agembeet al. 2010). Landings are known to be unreported in some countries of East Africa (Jacquet et al. 2010).",decreasing,"This species inhabits coral and rocky reef, including drop-offs and banks (Randall 1995, J. Robinson pers. comm. 2007, Stephenson et al. 2001). Juveniles can bemore common on coral reefs at least in the Persian Gulf, while adults are often found in deeper waters around sandy or rocky substrates (Carpenter et al. 1997). In general, younger individuals are found in the shallower portion of its range while adults occur deeper (Allen and Erdmann 2012). Its maximum total length is 90 cm (Allen and Erdmann 2012) and itsmaximum age is 30 years (Grandcourt 2005). In Australia, females mature at about 41 cm and the species has been aged to at least 22 years (Bray 2016). Spawning aggregations of Epinephelus multinotatus are reported during peak reproductive months (Wheeler and Ommanney 1953, Robinson et al. 2004) and non-aggregating spawning likely occurs at other times during the year (J. Robinson pers. comm. 2007). In the Seychelles, spawning occurs year-round with a peak from August to October during which spawning aggregations may form (Robinson et al.2007).","Overfishing is a threat to this species in parts of its range(Craig et al. 2011, Chabanetet al.2016). Reef degradation may also negatively impact this species (Pistorius and Taylor 2009).","There are no species-specific conservation measures in the Persian Gulf. Fisheries management is only in place in the Seychelles and Western Australia. Fisheries regulations are reasonably well-enforced in the Seychelles. The live reef food fish trade in the Seychelles was closed by the early 2000s due to sustainability concerns, conflicts with local fishers, biodiversity and economic viability (Aumeeruddy and Robinson 2006). This species receives some protection in no-take protected areas in South Africa, southern Mozambique, Chagos and Kenya. Fisheries management is well established in Western Australia through five separate commercial fishing zones for a mixed demersal fishery, which includesthis species. The management plans are under review due to concerns of growth overfishing. Ningaloo Marine Park in Australia, which is closed to commercial fishing, provides some protection to this species (Stephenson et al. 2001). Demersal fishing rules for the recreational fishery in Australia are also applicable to this species<span lang='EN-IN'>.","This species is taken in fisheries in much of its range. Itis mainly caught using hook and line and traps and may also be a component of bycatch in trawl fisheries (Heemstra and Randall 1993).It is a primary commercial species in Kuwait's gargoor trap fishery (Chenet al.2012). It is a highly prized food fish in Australia (Bray 2016).Thiswas the sixth most important species out of seven in terms of exported quantities for the live reef food fish trade in the Seychelles, but this export has been banned since the early 2000s.</p."

It is taken in fisheries in several areas within its range, including certain areas where spawning aggregations are targeted. Fishing is not known to be causing global-level declines at this time; therefore, it is listed as Least Concern. Monitoring and management of exploited populations, especially where spawning aggregations are targeted (e.g., Malaysia, Borneo, Okinawa and the Solomon Islands) is strongly recommended.","This species is distributed in the Indo-West Pacific from East Africa to the Marshall Islands and Fiji, and Australia (Queensland and the northwest offshore reefs) to the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands, Japan (Allen and Erdmann 2012). Its distribution includes Somalia, India, Maldives, Seychelles, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, Philippines, Palau, parts of Melanesia, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea,New Caledonia and Tonga (Heemstra and Randall 1984, Randall et al. 2003). Its depth range is 5-25 metres.","This species is common in sheltered coral-rich habitats. It is the dominant grouper species in the Naha market in Okinawa, Japan and spawning aggregations are likely targeted there (S. Kakuma pers. comm. 2014). In Okinawa, 40% of annual landings were observed during the reproductive season in the last quarter moon. Maximum daily catches peaked at about 800 kg in 2007 and around 600 kg in 2008, with catches of 40 kg per day per boat being common and up to 100 kg per day per boat during peak aggregation periods (Ohta and Ebisawa 2015). The description by these authors suggested the capture of males during the early portion of the aggregation period, followed by catches of females.It represented 0.3% of experimental grouper catch in New Caledonia (IRD database). It is not common in fisheries catches in the Maldives. There are declining catches of groupers that includes this species in Sabah. This species appears to be targeted in some instances during aggregation formation using spear, line and blast fishing in Malaysia (Daw 2004). Spawning aggregations in northern Borneo are thought to be extirpated. During a market survey in Pohnpei, Micronesia in 2005, only one individual of this species was observed (Rhodes et al. 2008). In 2015, 6 individuals were identified in the grouper catch at Pohnpei, which represented only 0.2% of the total number of groupers captured and the mean total length was 29.3 cm with a range of 24-32 cm (Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data). A market survey conducted in Honiara in the Solomon Islands reported this species as the 6th most commonly marketed grouper (302 individuals), a mean total length of 25 cm and range of 18-38 cm and only 46% of individuals were mature (Solomon Island Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data).In the Aceh, Weh Island (Indonesia) mixed-gear fishery, this species represented 1% of the total catch, and has a naturally low biomass there according to underwater surveys (Yulianto et al. 2013). During non-experimental and experimental line fishing along the Great Barrier Reef, this was the third most common species captured, with 1,153 individuals taken ranging in total length from 20-46 cm and aged 3 to 30 years (Mapleston et al. 2009). It represented less than 1% of the commercial and charter fishery catches along the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait (Currey et al. 2009).",unknown,"This species inhabits inner coastal and lagoonal coral reefs, but is also found in brackish waters on ledges and caves. Adults are usually found in 20 to 60+ metres depth (IRD database). It has been reported to occur in middle and outer shelf reefs, lagoons and back-reefs (Newman et al. 1997, Pears 2005). In Okinawa, it is highly associated with branching corals, particularly Acropora (Nanami et al. 2013). Its maximum total length is 40 cm (Randall et al. 1990), but more usually occurs to 31 cm total length (Heemstra and Randall 1993). This is acryptic species that primarily consumes crabs, fish, shrimps and prawns (Blaber et al. 1990).Based on samples taken and analyzed from the Great Barrier Reef, this species is likely a protogynous hermaphrodite, with 50% sex change occurring at 27.2 cm total length and 7 years of age (Mapleston et al. 2009).Spawning aggregations have been reported from Sabah (Daw 2004), Kavieng, Papua New Guinea and Roviana Lagoon, Solomon Islands (Hamilton and Kama 2004, Hamiltonet al.2005) and on sand/rubble substrate near a reef pass in Okinawa (S. Kakuma pers. comm. 2014, Nanami et al. 2014, Kawabata et al. 2015). Movement to and from the aggregation site in Okinawa ranged from 2.2 to 8.8 km with an average of 5-6 km (Nanami et al. 2015). It has been aged up to 20 years in Japan (Ohta and Ebisawa 2016), up to 30 years in Australia (Currey et al. 2009) and age at first maturity is about 3 years at a total length of 19 cm. Based on a longevity of 30 years, age of first maturity of 3 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynskiand Bellwood(2006), one generation length is estimated to be 16.5 years.","Fishing is causing localised declines in areas with intensive fisheries, especially in areas where spawning aggregations are targeted, but this is not considered a major threat on a global-level at this time.Coral reef degradation, particularly in areas where destructive fishing methods are used (e.g., Philippines, Indonesia) may negatively impact this species. Its apparent reliance and/or association with branching Acropora coralssuggests high susceptibility to habitat disturbance from climate change due to bleaching events caused by rising sea temperatures.","In Japan, fishing regulations for this species include size limits and marine protected areas, but it is unclear whether these measures are effective.In Australia, catch is regulated along with certain other groupers through a 38 cm minimum size-at-catch restriction. In Pohnpei, sale of this species is prohibited from 1 March-30 April annually since 1985 (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). In Chuuk (Micronesia), there is a catch, sales and export ban on grouper species from January-May. It occurs within the Tunku Abdul Rahman Park in Sabah, Malaysia (Townsend 2015). There are no specific data on whether any of these measures are effective in protecting this species.","Although not very common, it is of some interest to fisheries in Japan and the Solomon Islands (and probably elsewhere) and caught with hook and line, gillnets, spear and traps (Heemstra and Randall 1993).This species is a major target species in some parts of its range (e.g. Solomon Islands and Okinawa, Japan) and is part of the Southeast Asia-based live reef food fish trade. Its overall economic contribution to fisheries is unknown."

It is naturally uncommon, but can be locally abundant during spawning season when it migrates to sites to form sometimes very large aggregations. These spawning aggregations are heavily targeted by fishers through much of its range, and the species is frequently exported to supply the live reef fish trade based in Hong Kong.Due to overfishing, it has experienced steep population declines in many areas. Evidence of this is provided by anecdotal information collected during fisher interviews, depletion or extirpation of historical aggregations, reduced fish size, increasing catch of juveniles, underwater surveys and quantitative trends in landings exported to the international market. Specifically, exports to Hong Kong have declined by 71% over the past generation length (1999-2016), which reflects declines in population, not fishing effort. While a highly sought after species, it can now only be obtained in a few hundred tonnes each year (multiple countries combined) compared to most other popular (valuable) live fishes which are imported in thousands of tonnes. Declines have been documented in the following nine countries: New Caledonia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Tonga, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, French Polynesia, Maldives, Indonesia and Micronesia. Other countries where fishing is known to occur, but its status is not known include the following seven countries: Saudi Arabia, Solomon Islands, Seychelles, British Indian Ocean Territory, Tuvalu and the Cook Islands. Four more countries have documented exports to the Hong Kong market since 1999, but no further information is available (i.e., Taiwan which mostly produces groupers by grow-out of juveniles). Effective conservation measures to reduce fishing effort are in place in Australia; however, enforcement is lacking and insufficient to allow population recovery elsewhere. Given this, and its continued high-value in the international market, effort and declines are inferred to have been constant and may even increase into the future due to lack of management in all key supply areas for the live fish trade which is the biggest pressure for this species.Based on these data, a global level decline of at least conservatively 30% is suspected to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (a period of 69 years; 1947-2016). Therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bd. Actions are needed to reduce fishing effort on spawning aggregations, control exports (minimum size and quota) in the live fish trade, andespecially the implementation and enforcement of site-based protected areas and/or seasonal protection from fishing during the brief annual reproductive period. Improvements in data collection and population monitoring are also needed.The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea, along East Africa, south to Mozambique, and east to French Polynesia. In the western Pacific, it occurs from southern Japan to southern Queensland, Australia (Great Barrier Reef) and Lord Howe Island (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Its depth range is one to 60 metres.","This species is naturally uncommon throughout its range. Underwater surveys to 15 metres depth conducted in 17 countries and 71 sites between 2002 to 2009 indicate low numbers of individuals at most locales (e.g., Fiji, French Polynesia, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna). The species was not observed at Cook Islands, Nauru or Niue; however, the species may or may not be more naturally abundant in depths deeper than where these surveys were conducted (PROCFish/C/CoFish 2002-2009).According to microsatellite and mtDNA data, this species iscomprised of at least three main subpopulations: 1. the Indian Ocean (including Phuket and Maldives); 2.French Polynesia; and 3.the Eastern Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean (from Cocos Keeling to Fiji). A strong genetic break is located west of Cocos Keeling and a weaker one east of Fiji. Population differentiation within the Pacific Ocean and Eastern Indian Ocean population is generally weak, but the Cocos Keeling population was genetically distinct from all other populations (K. Yan Ma, K. Hou Chu, Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson, S. Newman, M. Berumen, J.H. Choat, L. van Herwerden unpub. data 2016). It is also likely that genetic sub-structuring occurs within Pohnpei (Rhodes et al. 2003) and the Solomon Islands.This species is heavily targeted during spawning aggregations, and therefore, declines in aggregation size are inferred to mirror overall population decline. Despite its very wide distribution, this species forms relatively few distinctive large spawning aggregations. At least 57 spawning aggregation sites across ten countries that are heavily fished have been documented, and these are very likely to represent a substantial proportion of its global level population (of sexually active adults). Of these sites, data are available for 25 of them, and about half of these have shown some or severe declines occurring over three generation lengths. Those where declines have not been detected are typically under some protection from fishing or are newly exploited (<a href='http://www.scrfa.org/'>www.SCRFA.org</a>database accessed November 2016). Declines in landings from aggregations have been reported from Palau, Indonesia, Pohnpei, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Aggregations have been nearly extirpated from the Philippines, Indonesia, Maldives, Malaysia, Solomon Islands, Melanesia (including Palau and Fiji) and French Polynesia, and declines have been observed in other localities as well. Virtually every place that this species is exploited has shown declining catches from aggregations with the exception of certain localities where effective conservation actions have been implemented and enforced (<a href='http://www.scrfa.org/'>www.SCRFA.org</a>database November 2016). This species is typically not often managed or otherwise protected.Imports of this species into Hong Kong, which is the global trade centre of the live reef food fish trade, have reportedly been sourced from the following countries at varying levels since 1999: Taiwan, the Philippines, Maldives, Malaysia and Indonesia. Sources are also reported to be mainland China, Vietnam, Thailand, but these come from other countries either by transit or are imported as juveniles and grown-out to market size (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017).Overall, imports to Hong Kong declined by about 71% from 700 to about 200 tonnes over the past 17 years (1999-2016) (Hong Kong government Census and Statistics Department). In the 1990s, this species comprised about 1,200 tons of the total annual volume of fish imported into Hong Kong (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999). These declines are attributed mostly to declines in the Philippines and Indonesia, which have typically been the two major source areas for this trade. This reflects declines in population, not declines in fishing effort.Due to its continued high-value in the market, effort is not expected to decline, and may even increase. Individuals of this species for retail sale aresmaller on average (closer to size of sexual maturation) as compared to 15 years ago (Lee and Sadovy 1998, Lam 2013). Since this species often co-aggregates with two other groupers also sought in the live fish trade(E. fuscoguttatus and Plectropomus areolatus), it will continue to be fished even if it yields only low numbers as long as the other species are present. Data from trade (predominantly the live fish trade which is the single major fishing pressure on the species), underwater surveys and catch indicate an overall suspected 30% decline over the past three generation lengths (a period of 69 years; 1947-2016).

Perumo and Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson pers. comm. 2016).Compared to past observations, this species is now infrequently seen in Indonesia and marked declines have been qualitatively noted in some localities (J. Pet pers. obs. 2016). Underwater surveys conducted in Komodo in 1998 and 2007 recorded a decline in mean size of this species: from 48 cm in 1998 to 39 cm total length in 2007, and a decline in abundance in aggregations of 46% occurred in 2004/2005 (Mangubhaiet al. 2011). Counts of this species across all aggregation sitesdeclinedfrom about 10 individuals in 1998 to zero in 2008. This species was not recorded during underwater surveys conducted annually at 19 sites in western and eastern Indonesia from 2004 to 2013 (COREMAP project S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016).It is rarely recorded in Indonesian fisheries, with just four individuals caught out of 210,000 reef fishes over multiple years (J. Pet pers. comm. 2016); this is due to overfishing since it was formerly not uncommon in coastal catches and known in multiple places to have spawning aggregations (the primary source of fish for this species).Of the eight spawning aggregations documented during fisher interviews by the Society for the Conservation of Reef Fish Aggregations (SCRFA), one has a stable catch per unit effort, but the remainder are reportedly in decline (<span lang='EN-GB'>SCRFA2014). Catch data from a major exporter, who also buys directly from fishers shows that out of 60 fish collection areas in the country (central to eastern areas) only two yielded this species out of all the groupers taken, in any numbers; at these two sites maximum monthly catches were between about 200 and 1,500 kg between 2014 and 2016 (Anonymous to Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2016).<span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'> <span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><strong style=''>Philippines: The Philippines’ Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources implemented an observer program at ports in 1999 and landings ofE. polyphekadion have been documented intermittently. Overall, landings have declined from a peak of 1,500 kg in 2001 and fluctuated between two and 230 kg with no clear trend since 2007, which represents about a 93% decline over the past 16 years (BFAR-NFRDI 2017). Until 2006, catch from the Philippines was a major source to the Hong Kong live reef fish trade, but has dropped to less than 20 metric tonnes annually. It is very likely, however, that imports reportedly from Malaysia over the last decade should actually be attributed to the Philippines (Hong Kong government Census and Statistics Department). Australia: There are no documented declines in Australian waters, but its status is not clear.The non-aggregation density on the Great Barrier Reef is generally less than 0.03 (Pears 2005).<strong style=''>Papua New Guinea: The species was fished in some areas of Papua New Guinea prior to 2004 for the live reef food fish export trade, but over the past decade, no imports of this species into Hong Kong have been recorded. In coral reefs of Milne Bay Province in Papua New Guinea, it is occasionally recorded (Werner and Allen 1998). Underwater surveys conducted in New Ireland Province between 2005 and 2009 reported significant increases in density of this species following effective protection of two of the three aggregation sites in 2004; fishing has virtually eliminated the aggregation at Bolsurik, one of the three known aggregation sites. Peak abundance in 2005 and 2009 at one protected site reached densities of 2.43 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>-2</sup>as compared to 0.02 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>-2</sup>in a non-protected area(Hamiltonet al.2011).<span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><span lang='EN-GB'><strong style=''>Maldives: The species has been fished in the Maldives for live export at least since 1999. In recent years, however, live fish exports have declined as the more valuable species, including E. polyphekadion have declined and chilled/frozen trade have increased in other species such as Cephalopholis species. This is thought to be a result of very severe overfishing of valuable species and a case of exporting whatever fishermen can catch(V. Evans and S. Hashim pers. comm. 2017). Such is the concern about the live fish trade that there is discussion about multiple management measures and even an export ban (Sattar et al. 2014).At least one spawning aggregation site exists in the Maldives, but its status is unknown (Sluka 2000). Underwater surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 in the Maldives recorded a density of less than one individual per 500 m². Estimated biomass in 2010 was 0.05 tons/km² and 225 tons throughout the entire Maldives. It is infrequently observed outside of the spawning season and is a generally uncommon species in the Maldives (Tamelanderet al.2008, Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). It was heavily targeted in the Maldives (Sluka 2002), but not particularly favoured by local people.This was once an important species taken for the Maldivean live reef food fish export trade to Southeast Asia (Johannes and Riepen 1995), but is no longer amongst the top 17 species of live fish exported. Since 1999, exports from the Maldives to Hong Kong were less than 50 metric tonnes a year, and since 2014, it has not occurred in any exports (Hong Kong government Census and Statistics Department). Its mean length in catchestaken from Baa, Kaafu, Vaavu and Faafu atollswas 20-45 cm (Sattaret al.2011).New Caledonia. Underwater surveys (2,000 transects) in New Caledonia indicated this species is not common in the zero to 10 metres depth (0.00009 fish/m²), but that sizes are large (41 cm fork length). Numbers of individuals dropped from around 4,500 in 1992 to 2,000 in 2002 at the Dumbea Pass aggregation site (C. Chauvet and E. Clua unpub. data 2006).This speciesis usually not retained by fishermen because it is often ciguatoxic, despite this, it is often found in the Noumea fish market (M.

The average size was 35 cm total length, and 34% were below the size of sexual maturity (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources unpublished data 2016).Underwater surveys conducted in 2009 at Njari Island (Ghizo, Western Province, Solomon Islands) recorded that aggregations formed densities nearing 25 individuals per 1,000 m². Aggregations of lower density were also observed at another site (Nusa Agana) in 2011 and 2012 (Hugheset al.2012). In Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, aggregations peak at around 300 individuals and a density of up to 15 individuals per 1,000 m² (Hamiltonet al.2012). Historical live reef food fish trade operations have predominantly been pulse fishing events that target seasonal grouper spawning aggregations.Historically, fishing pressure on reef fish resources of the Solomon Islands has been light, and catch rates ofEpinephelusspecies show no decline or only slight decline over the past few decades (Hamilton 2003, see also <a href='www.scrfa.org'>www.scrfa.org</a> database).<strong style=''>Tuvalu: Spawning aggregations occur on some atolls in Tuvalu and catch by fishers is for local consumption, with some minor exports from national urban centres. Anecdotal information from the 1990s did not reveal any significant population reduction (Passfield 1996), and the current status is unknown.<strong style=''>Fiji: Fisher interviews and field surveys that have been conducted since 2008 recorded that the spawning aggregation of Naiqoro Passage in Kadavu Island (Fiji), where large catches of this species were previously reported by fishers, had just a few hundred individuals remaining. Some aggregations near urban centres, such as Mali Passage, had completely disappeared (Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson and SCRFA unpublished data 2016). Interviews conducted from 2003-2005 with fishers showed marked declines in four different aggregation sites in northern Vanua Levu from about 100 kg to less than 20 kg per boat per day (Sadovy 2006). One major exporter exported approximately 20 metric tonnes of grouper in 2014, much of which is likely to beE. polyphekadion(N. Kuridrani pers. comm. 2015). In northern Vanua Levu in 2015, several reef passages along the Great Sea Reef still hosted this and several other groupers in aggregations despite heavy fishing and apparently declining numbers over the prior decade (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).Groupers were among the most intensively fished taxa around Kadavu Island in Fiji and abundance of this speciesranged from 0.15 to 1.84 g m<sup>-2</sup>in 10 fishing grounds in the area (Jenningset al. 1999). Nine aggregations around the coastline of Fijihave been identified for this species, seven of which are in decline based on catch per unit effort data collected during fisher interviews (<span lang='EN-GB'><a href='http://www.scrfa.org/'>www.scrfa.org</a>accessed 2015). On one aggregation, catch per boat per trip declined from 300 kg in 1985 to 100 kg by the mid-1990s and to only 12 to 20 individuals by 2002/2003 (Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson and Kuridrani unpublished data 2008). Grouper catches have been declining and effort increasing on northern Vanua Levu reefs as its export value remains high (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).Fisher interviews (n=63) indicated that catch on aggregation sites has declined about ten-fold over the past two decades around Fiji (Kuridrani 2008).Unregulatedfishing and poaching is still occurring according tolocal communities in much of Fiji(Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015).<strong style=''>Micronesia: Underwater monitoring conducted across Micronesian reefs between three to 10 metres depth, observed only nine individuals of this speciesat four of nine sites (P. Houk unpublished data 2016). Underwater surveys conducted across Micronesia recorded only four individuals of this speciesacross eight islands/atolls and 55 stations (about 29 total hectares surveyed)(B. Taylor unpublished data 2016).During a 12-month market survey in 2005, 383 individuals were sampled (20.7% of all groupers sampled), size ranged from 17.1 to 40.6 cm standard length and 47.4% were immature (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). A follow-up market survey in 2015/2016, reported that this species represented 30.2% of all groupers (n = 899), sizes ranged from 17 to 57 cm total length and 56% were immature (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).A12-month market and export survey in Chuuk in 2014 sampled 3,419 individuals of this species, which represented 11.2% of all fish landings and 5% by volume. Sizes averaged 33 cm and 45% were immature. Few gravid individuals were observed, which suggests that spawning aggregation fishing may be relatively low in Chuuk (J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).A very large spawning aggregation in Pohnpei is now substantially reduced from an estimated 20,000 fish in 1998 to 1,000 fish in 2013 (&lt;90% decline). Due tocontinued heavy fishing pressure on aggregations and take of juveniles, this species now has a truncated age and size in Pohnpei (Rhodeset al. 2011). Underwater surveys at the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary conducted from 2001 to 2013 recorded a declining trend in aggregation densities, from about 125 individuals per 100 m<sup>-2</sup>in 2005 to 25 individuals in 2013 presumably due to the lack of enforcement following 2005 (Rhodes et al. 2014). In 1999, local fishermen landed an estimated 4,000 pre-spawning individuals from the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary over a seven-day period, which is about 20–30% of the aggregation (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002a and b). In addition, both age and size were significantly reduced within the spawning population of the sanctuary in 1999, particularly in 13 to 18 year-old fish (Rhodes et al. 2011). Six aggregation sites were identified through fisher surveys conducted by the Society for the Conservation of Reef Fish Aggregations and fishers reported declines over multiple decades. The Ebiil spawning aggregation site once yielded high catches of groupers (Epinephelus polyphekadion, E. fuscoguttatus, Plectropomus areolatus), but according to fisher interviews, declined by about 86% from c. 1,500 kg per trip in the 1960s to less than 200 kg per trip in the early 2000s (PCS and SCRFA 2011). The site has been relatively effectively protectedsince 2010 (PCS and SCRFA 2011), and data indicate the population is no longer declining, but recovery to pre-fishing numbers is not yet known (Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2014).At least five grouper spawning aggregations of Palau have possibly disappeared since the 1970s according to fisher interviews (Johanneset al. 1999, Sadovy 2007, PCS and SCRFA 2010). Numbers appear to be increasing at the Ulong aggregation site due to improved protection (Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson and A. Bukurrou unpublished data 2015). It was once exported live to Hong Kong from Palau, but this trade has now been banned and is now used only domestically.<strong style=''>Cook Islands: Fishermen target spawning aggregations in Taruia Passage in the Cook Islands with catch rates of about 10 to 12 fish per man hour. Anecdotal information does not suggest significant reduction in population (Passfield 1996). No further more recent information is available from this area.<strong style=''>French Polynesia: A survey (510 transects) conducted across 10 atolls in French Polynesia in 1996 reported this species at adensity of 0.02 fish/m² and an average size of 34 cm fork length. This species was reportedly a major component of the commercial catch in the 1980s on Tikehau atoll in the Tuamotus, but is no longer observed there (M. Kulbicki pers. comm.2016).Many of the atolls of the Tuamotus have large aggregations of this species, and fishing has caused some of them to decline markedly (S. Planes pers. comm. 2010). Due to the presence of a tourist resort and biosphere reserve, a very large aggregation (10,000-20,000 individuals) on Fakarava Atoll is not fished (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Clua 2011, Y.

It is usually solitary or in small schools (Heemstra and Randall 1993). Maximum reported length is about 90 cm, but is typically no larger than 70 cm total length. The species appears to be gonochoristic (Rhodes et al. 2011), and hermaphroditism has been suggested, but not confirmed.Data from the Great Barrier Reef, New Caledonia, Pohnpei and Papua New Guinea suggest an age of sexual maturation at about four years and a maximum overall age of 42 years (Mapleston et al. 2009, Rhodeset al.2011, K. Rhodes and B. Taylor unpublished data 2016). In Papua New Guinea, maximum age was 22 years and age at maturity was 6.8 years (P. Waldie unpublished data 2017).Applying an age at maturity of four and longevity of 42, its estimated generation length is 23 years based on the following equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.This species migrates using regular reproductive migratory corridors of varying distances to form seasonal spawning aggregations that can contain hundreds to a few thousand individuals with a maximum reported at two sites (Pohnpei and the Tuamotus)of 20,000 (Robinson et al. 2008, Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Bijoux et al. 2013, K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). A study in Pohnpeishowed that spawning occurred on several nights during the full moon period during each of the months between February and April (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002a and b).Aggregation sites are known from Palau, Pohnpei (Micronesia), Mauritius, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands, Seychelles, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Maldives, Indonesia, French Polynesia (Tuamotus), New Caledonia, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Australia) and probably also in Malaysia. In a study conducted in Palau, mature females were between 30 and 47 cm fork length, mature males between 34 and 50 cm and immature fish between 24 and 29 cm, which indicates that sexual maturation occurred between about 29 and 30 cm (Johannes et al. 1999). Sexual maturation in 50% of females occurred at about 27 cm standard length in Pohnpei and there was no evidence for sex change (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002a and b). In Chuuk, 50% sexual maturity for females occurred at about 31 cm total length (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). It has a relatively low population turnover rate,and a natural mortality of 0.144 yr<sup>-1</sup>(Rhodes et al. 2011).","Overfishing by commercial and recreational fisheries is a major threat to this species. Spawning aggregation sites and timing are often widely-known by fishers, and easily accessed in outer reef passages. In some locations, the species utilizes predictable reproductive migratory corridors to and from aggregation sites, which increases its susceptibility to exploitation. Given its continued high-value in the international market, and the fact that fishing is insufficiently managed in most areas, it is inferred that populations will continue to decline, especially due to heavy fishing of spawning aggregations and the high frequency of juveniles in the catch (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Colin 2012). Secondarily, degradation of the coral reefs that this species inhabits is expected to increase due to impacts from climate change, including rising water temperatures. Land-based activities, such as logging and coastal development also contribute to reef degradation.","A number of management plans are in place for this species, although enforcement is mostly poor to lacking. Measures include minimum catch size limits, seasonal fishing bans, aggregation site protection and export bans.The export of wild-caught groupers from Indonesia is restricted to local Indonesian companies, which reduced fishing effort; however, some illegal trade remains (Anonymous pers. comm. 2016). In Indonesia's Karimunjawa National Park, there is a time and site closure for fishing ofE. polyphekadion(Yuliantoet al. 2015).Sincethe 1980s, the Pohnpei State Government has implemented measures to reduce fishing effort on groupers, including a sales ban during the main spawning season; however, subsistence fishing is still permitted and there are no limits on the number of individuals that can be taken. There is also a 16-inch size limit regulation in place in Pohnpei, but it is insufficiently enforced. The sales ban may also be mostly ineffective since aggregations in close proximity to population centres and major fishing villages are still targeted outside the ban period and during some spawning months not covered by the ban (i.e., February). As of 1999, the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary of Pohnpei was expanded to provide protection for aggregations, but effective enforcement is lacking and declines have been noted, particularly since private enforcement ended in 2005. In 2014, a second aggregation site at Ant Channel was protected by a combination of private enforcement and the implementation of the Pohnpei Ant Atoll Marine Sanctuary. A third possible aggregation site was protected in 2015 by the inclusion of Palikir Pass (Channel) in the Pohnpei marine sanctuary system; no foreign fishing vessels are allowed and there are entry restrictions for divers at one site.In Chuuk (Micronesia), the government imposed a grouper catch and export ban 1 January through 31 May that reduces fishing effort on this species (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).Concerns for the species in Fiji has led the government toconsider implementing protective measures during spawning season. In addition, a national campaign advising the public to not consume the species during spawning season aims to reduce take by local fishers.The Palau Marine Protection Act of 1995 prohibits the sale or purchase of Epinephelus polyphekadion(even for subsistence purposes) from April 1 through July 31, as a means to reduce fishing on spawning aggregations (Johannes 1999). This sales ban was recently extended to 31 October and there is a 3-year ban in Ngarchelong and Kayangl State from July 2015 until July 2018. In addition, foreign fishing vessels are no longer permitted, diver restrictions are in place at one site and there is a 50 pound maximum export per person. Enforcement of fishing restrictions has improved in recent years at the Ebiil aggregation site, which is located in a marine protected area (PCS and SCRFA 2010).Since December 2003, Australia has implemented several measures to reduce fishing on this species, including catch size and bag limits, restrictions on gear, limited entry for vessels into the reef fishery and establishment of marine protected areas (Queensland Government 2016). A management plan for the live reef food fishtrade was drafted for the Honiara market in the Solomon Islands in 2002 that aimed to provide total protection of spawning aggregations of E. polyphekadion by banning fishing on aggregations for five days on either side of the new moon during the three-month spawning season (Donnelly 2001) and modifying licence conditions (E. Oreihaka pers. comm. 2003); however, enforcement is lacking and only one aggregation site (Roviana) is protected.In New Caledonia, grouper fishing during spawning season in the area of known aggregations is restricted(M. Kulbicki pers. comm.2016). Management the live fish trade in theMaldives includes a 31-inch minimum size for E. polyphekadion (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011).To reduce heavy fishing by the live reef food fish trade in Papua New Guinea, a community-based marine protected area was implementedat the Bolsurik aggregation site that has measures to specifically reduce grouper catch. A recent monitoring survey showed that aggregation size had increased from 22 individuals in 2005 to 241 in 2009, which demonstrates the potential benefit of small-scale marine protected areas (Hamilton et al. 2011).Though almost all spawning aggregations of this species have experienced declines, a large one remains and is protected in the Tuamotu atolls of French Polynesia (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2017).","This species supports relatively low volume fisheries through much of its range, but is highly valued in the international live reef fish export trade of southeast Asia, and to a lesser extent in the western Pacific and parts of the Indian Ocean. Nearly all landings are taken from spawning aggregations. Currently, the major exporting countries are the Philippines and Indonesia; Thailand, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and the Maldives formerly contributed to the trade, but no imports to Hong Kong from these countries have occurred in recent years (Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department 2015). It is also commercially important in the southern part of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia (Rasemet al. 1997). It is caught with hook-and-line, spears and traps in Australia and Papua New Guinea (Heemstra and Randall 1993). It can be hatchery-produced, but this is not currently commercially viable."

Given that fishing is not known to be driving global-level declines at this time, it is listedas Least Concern. Improved monitoring and management of fisheries is strongly recommended, and research on life history would be beneficial.","This species is widespread within the Indo-Malay region and occurs from the Andaman Islands (India) to Australia (northern New South Wales at 29° 47' S and Shark Bay in Western Australia) and north to Japan and South Korea. Its depth range is 0-50 metres.Specific localities includeAustralia, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Taiwan Province of China, Philippines, Japan and South Korea.","This is generally regarded as a relatively abundant grouper species throughout its range (Craig et al. 2011). Population data are limited through much of its range. Declines due to overfishing are likely in some localities, including Hong Kong and Japan.   Hong Kong: Thiswas acommon grouper in Mirs Bays in the 1960s and juveniles of this species were frequently collected (Chan 1968). It was the most common grouper in the shallow and intertidal waters of Hong Kong (Chan 1968).This specieswas described as “moderately abundant” in underwater surveys conducted in Hong Kong that were published in 2000 (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). This species was also reportedly “commonly encountered’ in a study on artificial reefs in Hong Kong in the early 2000s (Wilson and Smith-Evans 2003), and a similar survey conducted during the same time period described it as “rare” to “common” (AFCD 2001). A subsequent underwater survey conducted in Hong Kong coral communities, rocky reefs and adjacent areas described this species as “uncommon” (To et al. 2013). This species was observed in 20.3% of underwater surveys in Hong Kong coral and rocky reefs and adjacent areas (n=187) conducted from 2014 to 2016, and most were observations of single individuals (Shea and Ho 2016). In the 1960s,the common size of this species was 20 to 36 cm total length (Herklots and Lin 1960, Chan 1968). A market survey conducted in Hong Kong from 2004 to 2006 recorded 500 wild-caught individuals of this species, 86% of which were caught within Hong Kong waters and about 30% were juveniles (To 2009, To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). It was the third most abundant grouper species in the market (To 2009). A survey conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Hong Kong restaurants and wet markets recorded 323 individuals of this species, which represented about 1.3% of all groupers surveyed in terms of number, and 49% were found to be immature (Lam 2013). The Port Survey report in Hong Kong in 1996/1997 and 2000/2001 did not record this species in the landings, but it is most likely lumped with other groupers (AFCD 1998, 2013).   Solomon Islands: A survey conducted at the Solomon Islands Honiara fish market in 2015 and 2016 reported that this species comprisedabout 0.3% of all groupers in terms of number of fish, and the average size was 24.8 ± 0.9 cm with a range from 19 – 31 cm (Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources).   Japan: The size of individuals of this species in catches off Japan ranged from 26 – 36 cm and the size was considered to be relatively small (Ohta 2008). Stock of this species is very likely to be declining in Japan ( K. Hoshino pers. comm. 2016).  <a> Mainland China: </a>A small number of underwater surveys conducted in Shenzhen (mainland China) around coral communities, rocky reefs and adjacent areas, observed this speciesin 17% of the surveys (To and Shea 2016).   Taiwan: During 10-15 years of underwater observation conducted in a very limited locality in Taiwan, this species was regarded as “abundant” (K-T. Shao pers. comm. 2016).   Australia: There are 97 records of this species in the Reef Life Survey databasefrom 2008 to 2016 with the majority being from the Coral Sea, Western Australia (Exmouth to Broome) and the Great Barrier Reef (Edgar and Stuart-Smith 2014). Underwater surveys conducted by Pears (2005) from 2000 to 2002 in several sites in the Great Barrier Reef described this as arelatively rare species compared to other groupers, and its estimated abundance was less than 1 fish per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>. An 11-year (1995-2005) line fishing survey (with supplementary catch from commercial fishing and fisheries-independent surveys of hand-spears and hook-and-line fisheries) conducted in the Great Barrier Reef (Lizard Island, Townsville, Mackay and Storm Cay) captured 347 individuals of this species with sizes ranging from 21 to 39 cm total length (Mapleston et al. 2009)   Indonesia: In Mentawai (western Indonesia), underwater surveys conducted at 10 stations in 2007 recorded 17 individuals per 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>and in 2010, the survey conducted in 18 stations reported3.2 individuals per 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>. In eastern Indonesia, underwater surveys reported 3 individuals per10,000 m<sup>2</sup>at Selayar in 2007 and 4.4 and 15.4 indivudals per 10,000 m<sup>2</sup>in Pangkep conducted in 2009 and 2011(S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016).",unknown,"This demersal species inhabits shallow, often silty, inshore waters from zero to 50 metres depth. It also occurs in coral reef habitat (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). It primarily consumesshrimps, worms, small fishes and crabs (Connell 1998, Sadovy and Cornish 2000). The maximum total length is 40 cm (Lau and Li 2000). Female maturity occurs at about 24 cm total length and about 1.8 years of age. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, and sex transition to male occurs at about 33 cm total length. The oldest specimen aged was 14 years old (To 2009, Maplestonet al. 2009). Based on a longevity of 14 years, age of first maturity of two years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynskiand Bellwood(2006), one generation length is estimated to be eight years. In Hong Kong, the spawning season is May to September (To 2009).","Heavy fishing pressure is a potential threat to this species on a localised level, but this is not known to be driving major declines on a global level at this time.","This species occurs in no-take marine protected areas in Hong Kong, as well as marine parks where fishing is allowed (Cornish 2000). It also likely occurs in many no-take zones within its range, such as in Australia (Wen et al. 2012).This species is subject to size and bag limits in Queensland, Australia (State of Queensland 2015).","This species is of some economic importance to fisheries in Hong Kong and Taiwan (Heemstra and Randall 1993) and can be found in live reef fish food markets in Hong Kong (Lau and Li 2000) and likely elsewhere in southeast Asia. Small juveniles are taken in the summer and larger fish are taken by gill net, hand-line and trap (Sadovy and Cornish 2000, To 2009). Juveniles are grown-out in cages on a small scale level in southeast Asia (Sadovy 2001, Craig et al. 2011)."

It is not known from the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf or Fiji. <span style=''>Its depth range is 1-150 metres, but typically occurs shallower than 30 m (Craig et al. 2011, Allen and Erdmann 2012, Roberts 2015).","This relatively small grouper species can be common in some parts of its range, although data are missing for several areas. It is likely to have been heavily exploited in many areas of its range (highly resident), but is still abundant in Western Australia and South Africa. Western Australian and South African populations may be genetically distinct (Zemlak et al. 2009). During underwater surveys conducted on Pacific shallow reefs from 2002-2009, only 9 individuals out of almost 16,000 groupers were identified as this species (Pacific Regional Oceanic and Coastal Fisheries Development Programme 2002-2009). Out of the more than 21,000 observations of serranids in the global Reef Life Survey, only 9 observation were of this species (Global Reef Life Survey database accessed October 2014). Fitzpatricket al. (2015) found greater biomass of this species inside sanctuaries at Ningaloo, Western Australia – perhaps because of relatively greater targeting of this species in this region, where it was the most commonly targeted fish and 2nd most commonly retained by recreational fishers in 1998/1999 (Sumneret al.2002). East Africa: The spawning biomass per recruit was reduced to ~80% of pristine levels on the east coast of South Africa in 1995-1997 (Fennessy 2000). In Mozambique, the catch per unit effort declined from an average of 3.2 kg/boat/day for 2002-2009 to 1.7 kg/boat/day for 2010-2014. This species is a relatively minor component of offshore skiboat hook and line catches on the east coast of South Africa by number and weight (Dunlop 2011). It is seldom caught in the surf-zone (Dunlop and Mann 2013) and is generally too small for recreational spearfishers. Catch per unit effort in the offshore fishery of KwaZulu-Natal from 1994-1996 was 0.01 (number) and 0.01 kg for the recreational fishers and from 2008-2009 it was 0.05 (number) and 0.03 kg. In the commercial sector, it was 0.38 (number) and 0.18 kg from 1994-1996 and 0.3 (number) and 0.1 kg in 2008-2009 (Mann et al. 1997, Dunlop 2011). This suggests the population has been relatively stable, assisted by a substantial reduction in commercial fishing effort in 2003. It contributed ~3% (by no.) to overall research boat catches in a marine protected area on the east coast of South Africa, and 8.5% in the adjacent exploited area (Maggs et al. 2013), possibly due to the ability of this species to exploit niches vacated by depletion of other, more targeted species.The species contributed an average of 2.3% (by number) and 1.1% (by weight) to overall catches in the semi-industrial linefishery in southern Mozambique from 2002-2014 (range in estimated total fleet catch of this species of 1.5–4.5 tonnes per year; R. Mutombene unpublished data); levels of relative contribution of this species have been variable since the mid-1990s when the fishery started up in earnest, although there is some doubt about the relative contribution of groupers prior to 2002 owing to port sampling biases; nominal catch per unit effort has been variable with no particular trend (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Information), except for a lower average (1.7 kg/boat/day) for 2010-2014 compared to 2002-2009 (3.2 kg/boat/day). Ogongo et al. (2015) reported this species as contributing 1.5% to grouper catches (total groupers, n = 401) by artisanal fishers from the south coast of Kenya from December 2013 to July 2014, respectively. In contrast, Agembe et al. (2010) did not record it from these fishers’ landings from February to July 2007.",unknown,"This species inhabits rocky and coral reefs, as well as algal flats and seagrass beds. It favours lagoonal areas (Mackie 2000). Its maximum total length is 45 cm. It primarily consumesfish and crustaceans. This species is amonandric, protogynous hermaphrodite (Mackie 2000, Fennessy 2000).It hasa relatively fast growth rate, but is relatively long-lived, having been aged to 24 years (Mackie 1998)<span style=''>. It matures at a small size/age, with the smallest mature female recorded at 14.4 cm total length in Australia (one year of age) and the smallest mature male was 22.1 cm total length (Mackie 1998). Based on a longevity of 24 years, age of first maturity of 1 year, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynskiand Bellwood(2006), one generation length is estimated to be 12.5 years.Size at sex transition varied in Western Australia from 26.3 to 31.5 cm total length (Mackie 2000).In South Africa, based on sampling of commercial catches, males outnumbered females 1.25:1 as a consequence of the fishery targeting larger individuals (Fennessy 2000). In contrast, at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, in an area closed to fishing and based on research sampling, females were five to six times more numerous than males. Females had overlapping home ranges, while males were territorial towards each other and their territories rarely overlapped (Mackie 1998, 2000). Males aggressively defended their territories during the spawning season. Fish are reproductively active over an extended period in the austral winter and spring in both Australia and South Africa when water temperatures are cooler (July to December; Mackie 2000, Fennessy 2000). Peak spawning occurs from September to December in Australia) and August to November in South Africa). Nzioka (1979) recorded ripe fish in October in Tanzania, while Morgans (1964) reported ripe fish in August off Kenya. Mackie (2000) observed that they do not form spawning aggregations at Ningaloo Reef, although numbers of females in male territories increased up to threefold during the spawning period; he ascribed the non-formation of “classic” aggregations as a consequence of this species naturally occurring in relatively high densities in this area. Spawning occurred in pairs, with gametes being released about 1.5 m above the substratum (Mackie 2000). This speciesdoes not form dense aggregations in order to spawn, although it can occur in fairly high densities. As well as reducing their vulnerability to fishing relative to species which do aggregate, this feature facilitates regular interaction between males and females which forms the basis of social cues for sex change (Mackie 2006). Pillans et al. (2012) concluded that this species was highly sedentary at Ningaloo, Western Australia, concurring with earlier work by Mackie (2007) who estimated home range to be in the order of 94-200 m<sup>2</sup>.","Overfishing may be a localised threat in areas where aggregations of this species are targeted, but this is not considered a major threat on a global-level at this time. The common occurrence of non-functional spermatic tissue in ovaries, and the simultaneous proliferation and degeneration of male and female tissues, was suggested by Mackie (2006) as mechanisms to facilitate rapid sex change. Together, these features suggest that Epinephelus rivulatus can compensate for the selective removal of (larger) males by fishing (observed in the South African fishery), which partially determines the extent to which stock can be harvested. Overall, a combination of small size, fast growth, early maturity, early and rapid sex change has better equipped this species to withstand fishing pressure than many other groupers. Age at first capture is much higher than age at 50% maturity in Western Australia and South Africa.","In South Africa, a maximum of five individuals of this species may be retained by recreational fishers per day, but there are no limits for commercial fishers. In Mozambique, a maximum of 10 individuals of demersal species may be retained by recreational fishers. There are daily bag limits of 2-4 fish depending on state in Australia. This species occurs in marine protected areas within its range. There are some no take-areas in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique (Wells et al. 2007), but the level of compliance is not understood. In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, most of the north coast is protected by a 145 km long marine protected area in which no demersal fishing is allowed, and is strictly enforced. This area is expected to be extended into southern Mozambique from Ponta d’Ouro to Maputo. Additional marine protected areas in South Africa are to be proclaimed in the next few years, which will provide additional protection.","This relatively small grouper species is taken in small-scale fisheries in several parts of its range. It is targeted by recreational fishers in Western Australia and is a bycatch of other targeted reef fishes in South Africa (commercial and recreational). Reasonable-sized individuals are retained for consumption in Western Australia and South Africa. In Hong Kong market surveys conducted from September 2012 to March 2013, this species comprised less than 0.1% of groupers for sale (S. Lam unpublished data); in 2004-2006 market surveys, this species was not observed (To 2009)."

It can be locally abundant, and is an important food fish throughout parts of its range. Although there is evidence of some localized declines and extirpations as a result of heavy fishing pressure (e.g., off Hawaii), there have not been observed or suspected population declines in most parts of its range due to exploitation events, and additional, quantitative data are lacking.This species is widely distributed in the West Pacific around isolated oceanic islands where it is subject to low fishing pressure and it is assumed that in these areas it is still locally abundant. For this reason, this species is assessed as Least Concern.Monitoring of the population trends and harvest levels of this species in areas where it is heavily fished is recommended.","The Ruby Snapper, Etelis carbunculus, is found throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is known from the coast of East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, across the Indo-Pacific, north to Japan and south to Australia. In the Pacific, its range extends to Hawaii, including French Polynesia (Anderson and Allen 2001). It has also been recorded from Three King's Island in northern New Zealand (Francis et al. 1999) and out to both Christmas and Cocos Islands (S. Newman pers. comm. 2010). This species is found in depths ranging from 90 to 400 m (Anderson and Allen 2001).","Population data are limited for this species. There are 95 occurrences on record, globally, with each lot containing between 1 and 3 individuals (Accessed through the Fishnet2 Portal, www.fishnet2.net, 2015-11-02).In Hawaii, Misa et al. (2013) found that in deep-water, rocky habitat, this species is relatively abundant.",unknown,"This species inhabits rock and rocky reefs near the benthos on the continental shelf, and feeds on fishes and large invertebrates such as squids, shrimps and crabs. It also feeds on planktonic organisms (Haight et al. 1993). This demersal species is known from a depth range of 90 to 400 m and is known to occur in aggregations (Anderson and Allen 2001). At Vanuatu (New Hebrides), spawning occurs throughout much of the year, with a peak in activity around November (Allen 1985). In Papua New Guinea, this species was found to be fully mature at 61 cm (Lokani et al. 1990), but in Hawaii, this species is reportedly mature at a length of 30 cm (Misa et al. 2013). The maximum fork length measured for this species is 127 cm (Smith and Kostlan 1991).","Etelis carbunculus is an important food fish in some areas (Allen 1985). It is mainly caught with bottom longlines and deep handlines, and is marketed fresh or frozen (Anderson and Allen 2001). It is one of the principal species in the Hawaiian offshore handline fishery. There are indications that some fish stocks on Hawaiian banks have been severely over-fished (Haight et al. 1993). Misa et al. (2013) found that E. carbunculus had an estimated spawning potential ratio well below 20%, indicating that the stock is in a state of recruitment overfishing. Fishery reports for the Hawaiian Islands indicate that the catch rates of E. carbunculus have declined steadily since the 1950s, and have dropped more steeply in the last 10 to 15 years. As the catch rates have dropped, so have the proportion of mature fish in the catches (DAR 2002). The Hawaiian landings of this species have dropped from approximately 18,100 kg in 1998 to 10,900 kg in 2003. Moffitt (1980) noted that the CPUE (Catch per Unit Effort) was 0.06 to 0.08 kg/line hr in the North West Hawaiian Islands in 1980.Over the last 40 to 50 years, partial CPUE has been reduced to half of what it once was (Hawaii's Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy 2006). This species is considered locally depleted in the middle Hawaiian Islands, whilst all bottomfish populations are considered relatively healthy in the North Western Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii's Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy 2006).This species is also commercially fished in the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDWTF) in south-western Australia. This species has been intensely fished in this area and due to its aggregatory behaviour with preference for restricted continental shelf habitats, it is vulnerable to heavy fishing. As a result it is reported to be over-fished in this area and the catch rates of this species are thought to have fallen (Hunter 2008).","There are no species-specific conservation measures for Etelis carbunculus;however, the distribution of this species intersects within numerous marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP 2014).Monitoring of the harvest levels is needed with further research on the extent of the fishery. Conservation measures need to protect important spawning aggregations.In federal waters of the US Western Pacific, the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council manages the Deep 7 bottomfish species. Previously these species were managed under the Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, but since 2010 have been managed under the Hawaii Fishery Ecosystem Plan (WPRFMC 2009) (WPFMC 2010).Management measures under the federal plan include a ban on destructive fishing techniques, a prohibition on fishing at Hancock Seamount, size limits, limits on fishing effort, gear restrictions, a recreational bag limit, and catch reporting (WPRFMC 2010). As well, a total allowable catch limit is set for the Deep 7 bottomfish species. For the 2012-13 and 2013-14 fishing years, the annual catch limit was set at 346,000 lbs. (FR 2013). If the catch limits is project to be reached, the fishery for the Deep 7 bottomfish may be closed. If the catch limit is exceeded, the catch limit for the following season may be reduced by the amount of the overage. In state waters the Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (HDAR) part of the Department of Land and Natural Resources, is responsible for fisheries management. Management measures in state waters include annual vessel registration, catch reporting, gear restrictions, minimum sizes (Onaga and Opakapaka) and closed fishing areas (DLNR 2013). If the fishery for the Deep 7 is closed in federal waters because the annual catch limit is reached, the State may close their waters to fishing for the Deep 7 species as well. Management goals for abundance and fishing levels have been established for the Deep 7 complex as a whole but not for individual species (Brodziaket al.2014). As a result, the impact of the fishery on individual species remains unclear (Blue Ocean Institute 2014).","This species is harvested as food throughout the majority of its range and is an important food fish in some areas (Allen 1985).In Kimbe, Manus and Oro bay, Rabaul CPUE efforts in the late nineties were 0.57 to 1.41 kg/line hr (Chapman 1998)and 0.001-0.31 kg/line hr, respectively (Wellington and Cusack 1998).It is thought that the Australian and the Hawaiian parts of its range are heavily fished.This speciesis also commercially fished in the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDWTF) in south-western Australia.

This finding may reflect the time it may take a long-lived and slow-growing species to show a detectable response to protection (Moore et al. 2013). In 1998 this species showed evidence of being overfished in Hawaii (Moore et al. 2013).In Australia this species makes up a significant proportion of the catch in deepwater line fisheries in some areas and years.

The maximum observed age of this species is 18 years. Etelis coruscans reaches 50% of asymptotic length at 5.6 years at 31% of potential longevity (Williams et al. 2013).The reproductive lifespan (RLS) is estimated at 11.6 years, and the natural mortality is 0.31 (Martinez-Andrade 2003).Size at 50% maturity 66.3 cm (fork length) (Everson et al. 1989). This peak spawning season of this species is summer, although intermittent spawning occurs during the rest of the year (Sumpton et al. 2013).There are two morphs present in this species: long-tailed and short-tailed forms. The caudal-fin length may be sexually dimorphic. Both forms are present in the vicinity of Fiji, where the short-tailed form is restricted to seamounts and the long-tailed form, although found on seamounts, occurs more commonly on island slopes (Anderson and Allen 2001).","This species is an important food fish in some areas. This species demonstrates relatively high longevity and slow growth, indicating that it has a relatively low production potential and higher vulnerability to the impacts of fishing (Cheung et al. 2005, Sumpton et al. 2013).Due to the limited potential for further commercial development of nearshore fisheries in the Pacific, there is increased interest in further developing deep-water fisheries (Williamset al. 2013).","This species' range overlaps with marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP 2014). It is managed to varying degrees throughout its range. In the Hawaiian Islands, this species is part of the subset of deepwater fishes known as the 'Deep 7' and is managed by total allowable catch (TAC) regulations. In response to overfishing in the late 1990s, the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources implemented 19 Bottomfish Restricted Fishing Areas throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, which covered 20% of the essential fish habitat for this species (Moore et al. 2013).

While in Micronesia, juveniles were observed to occur among branching corals (Myers 1991).Colour phase varies drastically according to age and sex (Allen 2000, Kuiter 2006), juveniles are green and with a main white bar developing behind pectoral fin, at about a length of seven cm (Kuiter 2002) individuals develop a characteristic bi-colour pattern with pale anterior and dark posterior (Allen 2000). Diet varies from demersal planktonic crustaceans to hard-shelled invertebrates with growth (Myers 1991). It feeds by picking at dead branching coral or taking in mouthful of sand, sorting out small invertebrates including crustaceans, polychaetes, mollusks and brittle stars in the mouth, and then expelling the sand through the gill operculae (Westneat 2001, Grutter et al. 2002). The highest feeding rates occurred at mid-day with approximately 1.65 bites per 30 min and it does not feed at night (Grutter et al. 2002).At One Tree lagoon, Great Barrier Reef, the percentage mortality of the newly settled H. melapterus during the first 12 months was 51 % and the annual mortality was 18.6 +/- 1.6 %. Initial phase have been observed to move away from their home-range when becoming adults, thus, it is worth noting that the mortality might involved component of emigration (Eckert 1987). Lewis (1997) revealed that the maximum percentage of post-recruit immigration at Heron Island, Australia, was 24.3 % and H. melapterus was more abundant on the reef flat than on the slope due to the influence of prey specific preference.Gills of this species have been found to accommodate many gill- inhabiting copepods, Hatschekia hemigymni (Grutter 1994, 2002) and the ectoparasite numbers and compositions inhabiting the body varied spatially and temporally in the Great Barrier Reef (Grutter 1994). Grutter et al. (2002) suggested that the immune system of the juveniles are not as competent as the larger fish, thus, a high density of parasite Benedenia lolo was found on the relatively smaller fish. Grutter (1998) also analysed the differences in the abundance of parasites and suggested that the home range of this species was about hundreds of metres.","There are no major threats known for this species, although it is targeted by spearfishers and is collected for the aquarium trade and in multispecies fisheries.","There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species.

In Phillippines:It is worth noting that those captioned marine parks do not necessarily equal to no-fishing areas since limited fishing activity is allowed. For instance fishing is allowed in Sumilon Island reserve and H. melapterus is reported to be targeted by local fishers. The mean density of H. melapterus in Sumilon Island Reserve has been observed to decline after fishing was allowed within the reserve areas (Russ and Alcala 1989).In Western Australia, there is no legal catch size for Labridae but daily catch limit is seven individuals per angler. No spear-fishing is allowed within the Ningaloo Marine Park (Government of Western Australia 2008a).

The species is fast-growing, relatively short-lived, and highly productive.Based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or SSB/SSB<sub>0</sub> in the Western and Central Pacific, Indian and West Atlantic Oceans, there has been an estimated 2–24% decline in the population globally over the past three generation lengths or 10 years (e.g. given available data ranges of 2003/2008–2013/2018). Overfishing is likely not occurring in any of the stocks, but may have occurred in 10% or more of the species' range sometime over the past five years.This species is listed as Least Concern under criterion A1. As this species has a circumglobal distribution and a very large global population size, it does not meet any of the thresholds for criteria B, C or D, and criterion E cannot be applied because a quantitative analysis of future extinction probability is not available. However, it is important to note that there is no adequate measure of population trends for this species in the Eastern Pacific, and that an estimate of no change in the East Atlantic population is based on visual inspection of CPUE trends. Additionally, fishing mortality is continuously increasing for both adults and juveniles in at least the Western and Central Pacific, and the 2017 provisional catch estimate for the Eastern Atlantic is greater than recommended.","Skipjack Tuna are circumglobal in seas warmer than 15–18 °C. They are found throughout the warm Atlantic including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. They are common in the eastern Atlantic including the Gulf of Guinea and the Mediterranean Sea but are absent from the Black Sea. They are widespread throughout the Indo-West Pacific. In the eastern Pacific, they have been reported from Gulf of Alaska to northern Chile, including waters of the oceanic islands (Collette and Graves 2019).","Skipjack comprise about 60% of the commercial tuna catch worldwide and are mostly used for canning. As of 2014, global landings of Skipjack Tuna exceeded three million metric tonnes (mt), the third highest fisheries catch, exceeded only by Alaskan Pollack and Peruvian Anchovy. They are captured near the surface mostly with purse seine gear and increasingly in association with FADS (fish aggregating devices). They are also caught on pole-and-line gear, troll, handline, in gill nets, drift nets, longlines, and by recreational fishers.Global catches of Skipjack Tuna increased from 165,000 metric tons (mt) in the 1950s, to over one million mt in the late 1980s, to over two million mt in the 2000s, and are currently in excess of three million mt. Skipjack stocks are assessed and managed by four recognized tuna regional fisheries management organizations (Collette and Graves 2019), in the Eastern Pacific, the Central and Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Two methods were used to estimate the change in population size for Skipjack within each management region over the last three generation lengths, or 10 years. In the first method ('method 1'), the change was calculated based on the linear per cent change in population size over the three generation lengths using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method ('method 2'), and to account for non-linear trends, the average annual per cent change in population size over the time period for which data are available was calculated, and then used to estimate the change in population size over the last three generation lengths, assuming an exponential decline. Skipjack data for the Indian Ocean were extracted via digitization. To ensure annual data, prior to estimating changes in population size, where more than one data point existed for any given year, the average of those data points was taken. If, conversely, no data point corresponded to a year, we estimated that data point as the average of the preceding and following years. Data beyond annual catches for the Eastern Pacific, in the form of an adequate population abundance proxy, were unavailable and we therefore assumed zero change in population size. The same assumption was also made for the Eastern Atlantic due to the relative abundance index for the species exhibiting no consistent trend over the last 10 years.In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or SSB/SSB<sub>0</sub> in the Western and Central Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the West Atlantic, and an assumed zero change elsewhere, there has been an estimated 2–24% decline globally over the past three generation lengths (10 years). Individual stocks were weighted by the average of the three highest historical catch estimates rather than MSY, as the latter is not known for all stocks. Details regarding these estimates are given below for each stock. In the majority of the Skipjack Tuna's range, the species is estimated to not be overfished and overfishing is not likely to be occurring. Eastern Pacific Ocean Purse-seine catches account for most of the Skipjack Tuna landings in the Eastern Pacific. Catches were less than 50,000 mt until the late 1970s, increasing to an average of 130,000 mt in the late 1970s-early 1980s, followed by a 10-year period of about 70,000 mt, increasing again with the expansion of the floating object fisheries in the mid-1990s. Currently (2010–2019), the catches ranged between 150,000 and 350,000 mt, with the highest catches registered in 2019 (IATTC 2020). Skipjack recruitment in the Eastern Pacific region is highly variable and is thought to be the reason for the large variations in annual catches and apparent stock size (Maunder 2019, Collette and Graves 2019, IATTC 2020). The catch in 2018 was 288,636 mt (IATTC 2019).Skipjack Tuna is notoriously a difficult species to assess. Detecting the effect of fishing on the population with standard fisheries data and stock assessment methods is difficult due to the species’ high and variable productivity (i.e. annual recruitment constitutes a large proportion of total biomass). This is especially true for the Eastern Pacific stock as a result of the lack of age-composition data, and in particular tagging data, which are needed for conventional stock assessments of Skipjack (Maunder 2019). Neither the biomass- nor fishing mortality-based reference points, nor the indicators that they are compared against, are available for Skipjack. Recent data- and model-based indicators are near its reference levels (IATTC 2020). Moreover, some fishery indicators are close to or in excess of historical reference levels, and the substantial increase in number of sets on floating objects in recent years is concerning (ISSF 2020a).For the Eastern Pacific stock, productivity and susceptibility analysis for the tropical tuna fishery in the region indicated that Skipjack and Bigeye have about the same susceptibility to purse-seine fishing gear, and that Skipjack Tuna is much more productive than Bigeye Tuna (Thunnus obesus) (IATTC 2020). Biomass and the fishing mortality that corresponds to MSY (F<sub>MSY</sub>) are, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with productivity, while susceptibility is related to fishing mortality. Since Skipjack and Bigeye have about the same susceptibility, the status of Skipjack can be inferred from the status of Bigeye, based on the 2020 assessment that used a risk analysis approach. Thus, there is less than 50% probability that F<sub>MSY</sub> has been exceeded (P(F/F<sub>MSY</sub>)&gt;1) = 50%), and less than 53% probability that S<sub>cur</sub> is below the dynamic S<sub>MSY</sub> (P(S/S<sub>MSY</sub>_<sub>d</sub>)&lt;1 = 53%). Tagging data that may inform a stock assessment for Skipjack is currently being collected.It is therefore assumed that the Skipjack population in the Eastern Pacific has remained more or less constant over the past 10 years, and the stock is not overfished or subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates in IATTC (2020), the Eastern Pacific represents about 10% of this species global population. Western and Central Pacific Ocean The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is responsible for the greatest production of Skipjack Tuna throughout the world’s oceans. Landings, primarily by purse seine vessels, increased from under 350,000 mt in the 1960s, to over one million mt in 1990, and reached two million mt in the 2010s (Collette and Graves 2019). The total provisional catch in 2018 was 1,795,048 mt (WCPFC 2019a).Based on the most recent (2019) stock assessment, Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific is moderately exploited and the level of fishing mortality is sustainable. The stock is above the adopted Limit Reference Point and fished at less than F<sub>MSY</sub> rates with 100% probability. The median value of F<sub>recent</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub> over the uncertainty grid of 54 models used to determine stock status is 0.45. The median SB<sub>recent</sub>/SB<sub>MSY</sub> is 2.58. The stock is therefore not overfished or subject to overfishing. However, fishing mortality is continuously increasing for both adults and juveniles, and spawning biomass is at its historically lowest level (WCPFC 2019a). Based on median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and using method 1, there has been an estimated 27% decline in the Western and Central Pacific population between 2008 and 2018, and 0% change using method 2. This stock is not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates in WCPFC (2019a), the Western and Central Pacific represents about 62% of this species global population. Indian Ocean In the Indian Ocean, Skipjack are captured in a variety of fisheries, with the purse seine, gill net, drift nets, and pole and line fisheries each contributing between 20 and 35% of the landings which were 394,000 mt in 2015. Skipjack landings in the Indian Ocean reached 100,000 mt in the mid-1980s, exceeded 400,000 mt in the 2000s, peaking at 600,000 mt in the mid-2000s (Collette and Graves 2019). The catch in 2016 was 446,723 t (IOTC 2017a).The 2017 stock assessment results are significantly different from the previous (2014 and 2011) assessments. The difference is mainly due to: (1) the correction of an error in small fish selectivity specification in the previous assessment; (2) the addition of tag-release mortality in the model; and (3) the assumption that effort creep is 1% per year since 1995 for the standardized European purse seine CPUE. The 2017 assessment indicates that the stock is at the target biomass reference point and that current and historical fishing mortality rates are below the target. Current spawning stock biomass relative to unexploited levels is 40%. On the weight of this and other evidence, Skipjack was determined to not be overfished or currently subject to overfishing (IOTC 2017a). Based on the time series of median SSB/SSB<sub>0</sub> from the agreed Indian Ocean (IO) grid models presented in IOTC (2017b) and using method 1, there has been an estimated 36% decline in the Indian Ocean population between 2006 and 2016. Using method 2, the estimated decline is 12% over the past 10 years. However, in the Indian Ocean, Skipjack is not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates in IOTC (2017a), the Indian Ocean represents about 18% of this species global population. Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea Skipjack are managed as two stocks in the Atlantic Ocean, with the eastern stock contributing about 85% of the landings. In total, Skipjack landings in the Atlantic gradually increased from over 100,000 mt in the 1970s to over 250,000 mt in the 2010s, with considerable year-to-year variation. Purse-seine catches account for more than 80% of Atlantic Skipjack landings overall, with baitboat catches representing a little less than 20% (Collette and Graves 2019). The Mediterranean is currently considered a separate stock. Catch has increased in the Mediterranean Sea in recent years, but statistics from this region are incomplete (Collette and Graves 2019). The preliminary estimates of catches made in 2018 in the East Atlantic amounted to 282,427 t, which is an increase of about 85% as compared to the average of 2005–2009 (IATTC 2020). Relative biomass (B<sub>2013</sub>/B<sub>MSY</sub>) is likely greater than 1, and mortality due to fishing (F<sub>2013</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub>) is likely less than 1. It is therefore unlikely that the stock in the Eastern Atlantic is overfished or that overfishing is occurring. It is, however, recommended that the catch and effort levels do not exceed the level of 2012–2013 catch or effort given the (1) lack of quantitative findings for the eastern stock assessment, and (2) pending additional data (including on FADs and on the ongoing Atlantic Tropical Tuna Tagging Program) being submitted which are needed to improve the stock assessment. The 2017 provisional catch (2018 catch) exceeds this level by 11% (27%). In addition, increasing harvests and fishing effort for Skipjack could cause involuntary consequences for other species that, in certain fisheries, are caught together with Skipjack (ICCAT 2017, 2020). According to ISSF (2020b), the Eastern Atlantic stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.The relative abundance index (scaled CPUE index) for the Eastern Atlantic Skipjack (ICCAT 2017) does not exhibit a consistent trend for the last 10 years of data (approx. 2002–2012). We therefore assumed zero change in population trends for that stock. The relative size of the stock was estimated by averaging the three highest historical catch estimates in ICCAT 2017 (p. 63, SKJ-Table 1). The data range from 1993 to 2017, but from SKJ-Figure 3 it can be seen that catches were less prior to 1993 (ICCAT 2017).In the Western Atlantic, the 2017 preliminary catch estimate is 23,276 t (close to the 2018 estimate of 22,873 t). Relative biomass (B<sub>2013</sub>/B<sub>MSY</sub>) is probably close to 1.3 and mortality due to fishing (F<sub>2013</sub>/FMSY) is probably close to 0.7. The stock is determined not to be overfished or subject to overfishing. However, it is recommended that catches not exceed the MSY, currently around 30,000–32,000 t (ICCAT 2017). In summary, based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, and using method 1, there has been an estimated 3% decline in the Western Atlantic between 2003 and 2013. Using method 2, the decline is 4% over the past 10 years. Both the Western Atlantic and Eastern Atlantic populations are not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates (ICCAT 2017, ICCAT 2014), the Western Atlantic represents about 2% of this species global population, and the Eastern Atlantic about 8% of its global population. Mediterranean Skipjack have not been assessed, due to lack of data.",decreasing,"Skipjack Tuna are pelagic and oceanodromous in offshore waters to depths of 330 m (Collette and Graves 2019), with Schaefer and Fuller (2007) recording a dive as deep as 596 m. Their lower temperature limit appears to be about 18 °C, but the upper temperature limit apparently varies with size, from 30 °C or more for small fish to 25 °C for the largest fish. Skipjack are also limited to water with unusually high concentrations of dissolved oxygen, at least 3.0–3.5 ml/l (4–5 ppm) for long-term survival. Larval Skipjack Tuna occur from the lower portion of the mixed layer to the upper portion of the thermocline in a temperature range of 20–25 °C and a salinity range of 33.6–35.5.Skipjack Tuna exhibit a strong tendency to school in surface waters often in association with floating objects, sharks, and whales, but apparently not in the Mediterranean Sea. They often form mixed schools with small Yellowfin Tuna (Thunnus albacares) and Bigeye Tuna (T. obesus) when associated with floating objects, and in the Western Atlantic are commonly found in schools with Blackfin Tuna (T. atlanticus). The species feeds on fishes, squids, and crustaceans. It is preyed upon by large pelagic fishes, particularly billfishes. Skipjack Tuna are very fast-growing, relatively short-lived, and extremely fecund (Collette and Graves 2019).Longevity, as calculated from growth rings on the first dorsal spine or sagittal otolith, is estimated to be at least seven years (Collette and Graves 2019). Age of first maturity is estimated to be 1.5 years (Maunder and Harley 2005). In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, about 50% of the fish are mature by 0.75 years and more than 90% of fish become mature after about 1.5 years (WCPFC, 2019b). Size at first maturity is 40–55 cm Fork Length (FL), depending on the area (Collette and Nauen 1983, Matsumoto et al. 1984, Wild and Hampton 1994, Schaefer 2001). Estimated length at 50% maturity for females is 42–43 cm in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans (Cayre and Farrugio 1986, Stequert and Ramcharrun 1996, Collette and Graves 2019), and 47–56 cm, from southern to northern latitudes, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Schaefer and Fuller 2018). In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, Skipjack mature at a length of around 50 cm FL (Ohashi et al. 2019, WCPFC 2019b).Sex ratio is about 1:1 but fisheries that rely on young immature fish are dominated by females, while those that capture older fish are mostly male. This species spawns repeatedly, after reaching sexual maturity and with sufficient energy reserves, at sea surface temperatures of 24–30 °C: throughout the year in the Caribbean and other equatorial waters, and from spring to early fall in subtropical waters, with the spawning season becoming shorter as distance from the equator increases (Collette 2010). Batch fecundity increases with body length but is highly variable. Individual batch fecundity ranges from 80,000 eggs for a 44 cm female from Madagascar to 1.25 million eggs for a large (75 cm) female from the Seychelles Islands (Collette 2010, Collette and Graves, 2019). The estimated average batch fecundity, based on counts of late-stage migratory-nucleus or hydrated stages of oocytes from 129 fish from the eastern Pacific, was 296,475 oocytes, and the estimated mean relative fecundity was 54.9 oocytes per gram of body weight (Schaefer and Fuller 2018).Maximum size recorded is 111 cm FL and 34.5 kg (Bayliff 1988, Garcia-Coll et al. 1986, Collette 2010, Collette and Graves 2019). The IGFA all-tackle gamefish record is a 45 lb, 4 oz. (20.54 kg) Skipjack caught over Flathead Bank in Baja California, Mexico in November 1996 (IGFA 2020).Generation length for this species is estimated to be 3–4 years, following methods in Collette et al. 2011, and changes in population size are therefore estimated over 10 years.","Continued increases in purse-seine fleet capacities and targeting Skipjack within mixed species tuna aggregations associated with fish aggregating devices has resulted in increased catches of small Yellowfin and Bigeye Tunas, resulting in growth overfishing of both of the latter species in some management areas, and has also raised concerns about the sustainability of Skipjack catches (Collette and Graves 2019). In the tropical Pacific, increasingly El Niño-like conditions, including rising ocean temperatures, may lead to Skipjack shifting its distribution eastward and to higher latitudes, and be subject to a reduction in absolute biomass (Gilman et al. 2016). The current eastward extension (westward contraction) of Skipjack Tuna in the equatorial region during El Niño (La Niña) phases are caused by changes in temperature, prey and dissolved oxygen concentration (Lehodey et al. 2020). Eastern Pacific Ocean Skipjack Tuna is not deemed to be overfished or subject to overfishing. However, recent catches are historically high and the substantial increase in numbers of sets on floating objects in recent years is concerning (ISSF 2020b). Western and Central Pacific Ocean Recent fishing mortality does not exceed F<sub>MSY</sub> but fishing mortality is continuously increasing for both adults and juveniles (WCPFC 2019a). Indian Ocean Skipjack Tuna appears to not be overfished or subject to overfishing (IOTC 2017a). Atlantic Ocean Numerous changes have taken place in the Skipjack fishery since the early 1990s (e.g. the progressive use of FADs and the fishing area expanding latitudinally and westwards) and these have caused an increase in the catchability of Skipjack and in the proportion of exploited biomass. The main fisheries are the purse seine fisheries of Belize, Curaçao, EU-France, EU-Spain, Ghana, Guinea, Panama and Cabo Verde, followed by the baitboat fisheries of EU-Portugal, EU-Spain, Ghana and Senegal. Based on the preliminary 2017 catch estimate, catch has increased by 91% compared to the 2005–2009 average. In the Western Atlantic the main fishery is the Brazilian baitboat fishery, followed by the Venezuelan purse seine fleet. Estimation of 'faux poissons,' or the unreported catch of mixed, unidentifiable species, which is mainly composed of Skipjack should be improved to reduce uncertainty of the total Skipjack catches (ICCAT 2017).","Skipjack Tuna is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).Stock assessments and reference points for Skipjack in the Eastern Pacific are highly uncertain. Developing alternative methods to assess and manage the species that are not sensitive to these uncertainties would therefore be beneficial (IATTC 2019), and indeed the IATTC recently concluded a large-scale conventional tagging program (V. Restrepo pers. comm., July 2020). The most comprehensive method to develop and test alternative assessment methods and management strategies would be full management strategy evaluation (MSE) for Skipjack. However, developing MSE is time-consuming and is yet to be conducted for Skipjack (IATTC 2019). The main conservation measure put in place by the IATTC are Resolutions C-17-01 and C-17-02, which includes an annual fishing closure for purse seine vessels with a carrying capacity in excess of 182 tons. This measure calls for, amongst other restrictions, limits on the number of active FADs purse seiners can have (ISSF 2020b). In the Atlantic, the main binding ICCAT conservation measure is Recommendation 19-02, a multi-annual plan for tropical tunas. This plan prohibits purse seine and baitboat vessels fishing on floating objects,including their support vessels’ activities, in the high seas or EEZs during January-February (January–March in 2021). In addition, drifting FADs are not allowed to be deployed during the 15 days prior to the closure and there can be no more than 350 (300 in 2021) FADs with operational buoys at any one time per vessel (ISSF 2020b).In the Western and Central Pacific there is an area-wide temporal closure on FAD sets, but the numbers of FAD sets has been increasing annually (Collette and Graves 2019), both here and potentially elsewhere in the species' range (V. Restrepo pers. comm., July 2020). No more than 350 FADs with activated instrumented buoys can be deployed at sea at any one time per purse seine vessel (ISSF 2020b).In the Indian Ocean, Skipjack Tuna is not overfished or undergoing overfishing based on the most recent (2017) stock assessment. However, it can respond rapidly to ambient foraging conditions driven by ocean productivity because of its specific life history traits. There should be close monitoring of environmental indicators to inform on the potential increase/decrease in stock productivity (IOTC 2017a). IOTC has adopted an annual catch limit of 470,029 tonnes for Skipjack for the period 2018–2020 following application of the Harvest Control Rule in Resolution 16/02. A ban on discards of Skipjack, Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna by purse seine vessels is established in Resolution 19/05 (ISSF 2020b).",This species is extremely important in industrial commercial fisheries.

Juveniles are generally solitary in deep ledges and are rarely seen cleaning. Adults tend to move over larger areas to clean, rather than waiting at fixed cleaning stations like some other cleaner wrasses (e.g. L. dimidiatus) (Kuiter 2002). It shows pronounced cleaning behaviour which only occurs during the day. Labroides bicolor is active in the daytime, and may possibly produce a protective mucous cocoon at night. It is probably a monandric hermaphrodite, but might also undergo bi-directional sex-change (Robertson 1972, Kuwamura et al. 2002, Sadovy and Liu 2008, re L. dimidiatus).

Yusuf unpublished data).On the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, an estimated mean density of 4.55 individuals from twenty 50 m X 5 m transects was recorded in underwater fish visual surveys (Yusuf et al. 2002).",unknown,"This species inhabits coral rich areas and subtidal reef flats to seaward reefs to depths of at least 40 m. It is widely reported to be a monandric hermaphrodite but further confirmed to display bi-directional sex-change, exhibits socially controlled sex reversal and lives in single-male, multiple female social groups (Kuwamura 1984, Sadovy and Cornish 2000, Kuwamura et al. 2002, Sadovy de Mitcheson and Liu 2008). Males exhibit territoriality and the largest, oldest individual is a male which dominates all the females in the group (Robertson 1972, Nakashima et al. 2000). It feeds on crustaceans ectoparasites and mucus of fishes which gather at specific cleaning ‘stations’ for attention (Pott 1973). Males and females are the same in colour, juveniles are black with a single blue stripe running from snout to the upper part of caudal fin.It is active in daytime and is reported to be able to produce a protective mucous cocoon at night. Seasonal fluctuation of the activity rate has been observed with almost all individuals always active during late spring and early summer (Kuwamura 1981).In Japan, spawning occurred within 4-5 months of the year, from late May to early September. Larvae of about 1.8 mm in total length hatch at 30 hours after spawning (Kuwamura 1981).This species is monochromatic, spawns in harem. Spawning ascent distance was about three m with rapid ascending speed. Spawning activities were seen in March, May, June and November at Enewetak Atoll, Marshall Islands (Colin and Bell 1991). The size of eggs is approximately 0.64 mm and spherical in shape. Eggs contained multiple oil globulesMaximum size of species has been recorded at 22 cm (TL) in New Caledonia and maturity is reached at a size of about six cm TL (Kuwamura 1981, M. Kulbicki pers. comm.). All of the larger adults have an almost completely developed ventroanterior hook in the caudal fin. Maximum lifespan is estimated to be four years (Allsop and West 2003) and minimum population doubling time is approximately 1.4-4.4 years (Froese and Pauly 2008).It shows cleaning behaviour, which only occurs during the day and particularly in the early morning (Grutter 1996). In captivity it is affected by abundance and size-frequency distribution of the monogenean parasites on the host of fishes, which was more pronounced on larger fish than on small fish (Grutter et al. 2002). It spends 60 to 154 more times cleaning larger fishes (> 12.5 cm SL) than medium (9.5 to 12.5 cm SL) or small sized fish (< 9.5 cm SL). In the Great Barrier Reef, it was found to spend 256 +/- min per day cleaning 2297 +/- 83 fish (Grutter 1996) from over 132 species (Grutter and Poulin 1998). In New Caledonia, it spent 26% of its time inspecting a large number of fish (59.5 +/- 5.1 per 15 minute) (Grutter 1999).It consumes a large number of parasites (1218 +/- 118) each day or 4.8 +/- 0.4 parasites per minute (Grutter 1996) and most of the prey items were juvenile gnathiid isopods (Grutter 1997). The biomass of gnathiids in the diet in New Caledonia was lower than at Lizard Island, but higher than at Heron Island, suggesting that the role of gnathiids in cleaning behaviour is variable (Grutter 1999).At One Tree Lagoon on the Great Barrier Reef, overall mortality during first year for L. dimidiatus was 50%, juveniles do not shelter within the substratum and displayed relatively high mortality over the first twelve months (Eckert 1987). The average annual mortality ofL. dimidiatus was 11.1 +/- 2.2 %.","There are no major threats known for this species, although it is targeted for the aquarium trade and there are occuring coral habitat degradation in parts of its range.","There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species.

It has been observed to “clean” parasites from other fishes (Randall and Springer 1975, Allen 2000). It is reported that the combination of colour and dance-like movement of L. pectoralis is an advertisement to other fishes, including predators, for “cleaning” services (Kuiter 2002). “Cleaning” included removal of parasite, dead tissue from wounds, food scraps from teeth or gills. Juveniles were observed to be territorial, working singly along reef walls, while adults work in pair and specifically at particular caves which are known as “cleaning stations” (Myers 1991, Kuiter 2002).The mean plantktonic larval duration of L. pectoralis was 26.8 + / - 4.2 days and the highest larval duration was recorded to be 31 days in Palau (Victor 1986).","There are no major threats known for this species, although it is targeted for the aquarium trade and there are occuring coral habitat degradation in parts of its range. Overfishing, destructive fishing practices and pollution from the land have been reported within the area of highest coral reef diversity, such as the Philippines and Indonesia (Tun et al. 2004) and might cause habitat alteration or even loss. Such habitat alteration or degradation has been shown to influence the fish community (Öhman et al. 1997) and population depletions. Thus, habitat destruction might constitue as a main threat since most of this species habitat is in high coral cover areas.The marine ornamental trade is an expanding industry and there is a threat of overcollection of the target species since most of them are taken from the wild (Ochavillo and Hodgson 2006).

There is no special fishery forLepidocybium flavobrunneum in the Eastern Central Atlantic, but appears as bycatch in tuna longline fishery (Nakamura and Parin 1993, Parin in press). In the Western Central Atlantic, this species is not specifically targeted, but appears as bycatch in tuna longline fishery (Parin and Nakamura 2002). Levesque (2010) notes thatoverexploitationis not occurring in the northwestern Atlantic, but data clearly indicate a decline in the Escolar stock in the southwestern Atlantic. Overall, Levesque (2010) determined catch rates ofLepidocybium flavobrunneumare stable, which suggests overfishing is not occurring in the Western Atlantic. In the Pacific it is commonly caught in longline fisheries for tuna and swordfish and appears to be marketed for the sushi trade as 'white tuna' or 'super white'. The high wax ester content in the flesh can cause keriorrhea similar todiarrhoea. Known ways to reduce keriorrhea are to limit portions to six ounces or less. Escolar ismislabelledin restaurants and fish markets as 'white tuna' instead of Escolar. It is banned for sale in Italy and Japan because of purgative side effects. In the United States and Canada, it is not banned but there are fact sheets noting the potential adverse effects of consumption. In the Gulf of Mexico, bycatch and overall catch of this species has increased over the past few decades (Brendtro et al. 2008). This species is caught in commercial quantities by domestic longliners. The total observed catch ofLepidocybium flavobrunneum in the Gulf of Mexico from January to June 2007-2008 was 1,485. Of this total, 1,198 were kept, 84 were released alive, 111 were discarded dead and 92 were lost(Beerkircher 2009).et al. This species was caught during regular commercial fishing operations in the Gulf of Mexico by pelagic longline fisheries that were targeting Yellowfin Tuna and occasionally swordfish. The total retained catch forLepidocybium flavobrunneum was 153 from 79 longline sets that were sampled from November 1994 to May 1997 (Erickson and Berkeley 2008)."

Carpenter pers. comm. 2015). American Samoa This species is managed within the bottomfish resource management unit in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Bottomfish complexes were not depleted and were not experiencing overfishing in 2010. The status of this stock is based on fishery-dependent data, and there are currently no fishery-independent measures of relative or absolute bottomfish abundance (Brodziaket al. 2012).The commercial bottomfish fishery in American Samoa was established from 1982-1985. Of all bottomfish species landed in American Samoa,L. rubioperculatusand other emperors,Etelis corruscansandLutjanus kasmiraare the top landings in pounds comprising about 77% of total landings.Stock assessment of Bottomfish Management Unit Species (BMUS) indicated below maximum sustainable yield. Decline in bottom fishing catch has occurred with decline in effort in American Samoa. Additionally, declines in adjusted price of fish suggest declining fish consumption. In 2011, this species accounted for 11% of all bottomfish landings (3987 lbs/35808 lbs). In 2012, Annual Catch Limits were implemented (WPRFMC 2012). Guam In Guam, Lethrinids are the largest component of the bottomfish fishery. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) has declined consistently from the early 1980s until 2008. From 2008 to 2010 CPUE (lbs/hr) values appear to be increasing, however CPUE in 2010 is half that of the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s. High early CPUE values may be attributed to relatively unfished bottom areas being more productive. In Guam, Lethrinids have became rare on shallow reefs due to heavy fishing and possibly reef degradation due to natural and human impacts (Green et al.1997). Emperors are frequently incidental catch in the fishery for small carangids. Lethrinids in Guam have an Annual Catch limit of 38720 lbs. Coral reef fisheries around Guam have not been determined to be overfished however there are no existing stock assessments (WPRFMC 2012).

The relative contribution of L. amboinensis to the catch is unknown. Fishing effort (number of boats and number of trips targeting bottomfish) has declined steadily from 2006 to 2011. Commercial landings of Lethrinids show large fluctuations from 1983 to 2011, and have particularly fluctuated over the last 8 years. Catch-per-unit-effort (lbs per hour) has fluctuated from 2000 to 2011, with a slight decreasing trend. Catch-per-unit effort has declined consistently in the snorkel spear fishery from a series high of 3.5lbs/hour in 2000 to a series low of less than 0.25 lbs/hour 2011.

There was little change over time in the relative contribution ofL. harakto the catch from 1950 to 2007 (Harper and Zeller 2011).In the Wakatobi National Park, Indonesia, this species was among the most commonly recorded species in seagrass beds and was the most frequently observed species in fisheries catches. Forty-one percent of these were classed as juveniles. Of 252 households interviewed, 16.1% choseL. harakas their favorite food fish (Unsworthet al. 2014).Lethrinus harakis among the top 10 commercial species in Guam (Hensley and Sherwood 1993). Size and age at first capture is ~100 mm and 2 years below the size and age at first maturity (Taylor and McIlwain 2010). This species was listed as a species in need of conservation action in Guam due to steep declines in harvest levels since the 1980s and lack of legislation regulating theL. harakfishery (Taylor and McIlwain 2010). Despite being heavily targeted in GuamL. harakremains one of the few numerically abundant, carnivorous fishes encountered on reef flats (Tayloret al. 2012). Significant demographic differences betweenL. harakpopulations within and outside of protected areas suggest that protected populations are recovering from high exploitation in this area (Taylor and Mills 2013).In Fiji, this species is the most heavily targeted fish.

The length at first capture was 8.4 cm, while the length at maturity was 23.3 cm (Mangi and Roberts 2006).Catch statistics from the Central Statistics Office of Mauritius show a decrease of L. harakrepresentation in the total small-scale commercial catch from 1994 to 2008 (0.8% in 1994, 0.4% in 1995, 0.3 in 1996, and 0.0 from 1997 to 2008 with the exception of 1998 and 2004 when a proportion of 0.1% was recorded) (Harper and Zeller 2011).In Mozambique, this species is a major component of multi-species fisheries and is predominantly caught by hook and line (Kiszka 2012).This species was observed at each of six fringing coral reef sites around Nose Be island in the northwest of Madagascar and was found in high numbers over sandy patches (Lindénet al. 2002).In Rodriguez Island, western Indian Ocean the relative importance of this species in fisheries catches declined dramatically between 1994 and 2006. While being among the 6 species which accounted for 29% of the catch in 1994 to 1996, in 2004-2006 this overall proportion had decreased to only 6%. Fishermen in the area also reported perceived decreases in abundance of L. harak.

It is common across backreef and lagoonal habitats except turf-covered pavement (Taylor et al. 2012). This species utilizes seagrass and mangrove habitats as nursery grounds and as a larger adult begins to use reef habitat. Mangroves and mangrove edge habitats were intermittently occupied by many size classes when tidally available (Unsworth et al. 2009). This species feeds on polychaetes, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms and small fishes. It is often observed solitary but also in small schools (Carpenter 2001). Seagrass beds are an important nursery area for this species (Gell and Whittington 2002).The length range of 254 femaleL. harakobtained off the coast of Japan was 11.6 to 34.3 cm FL, with a mode at 26 cm FL (Ebisawa 2006). Lethrinus harak individuals have small, well-defined home ranges which are influenced by interspecific competition among similarly sized individuals (Nanami and Yamada 2009). Otolith-based studies found the longevity of L. harak to be 12 and 15 years for populations from Fiji and the Great Barrier Reef (Hilomen 1997, Lasi 2003). The home range of L. harak increases with body size (Taylor and Mills 2013). The maximum recorded length for this species is 50 cm (Carpenter and Allen 1989).This species is considered a protogynous hermaphrodite (Ebisawa 2006). Spawning aggregations of L. harak have been reported from Palau (Johannes 1981). Off the Ryukyu Islands, the age of 50% ovarian maturity was 1-2 years (Ebisawa and Ozawa 2009). The spawning period of this species in Japan was determined to be from April to November. The length of 50% maturity for females was 21.1 cm TL, and the length of 50% maturity for males was 19.5 cm TL (Ebisawa 2006). This species spawns throughout the year in Guam (Taylor and Mills 2013) Size at maturation in Guam was 20.8 cm, age at maturation was 3.8 years (Taylor and McIlwan 2012).",Lethrinus haraksupports important commercial fisheries in many parts of its range and evidence for declines has been found.,"In Guam, populations of L. harak within protected areas displayed greater longevity, mean size and spawner biomass as well as lower mortality than those outside, suggesting that protected populations are recovering from high exploitation (Taylor and Mills 2012).The following regulations have been proposed in Guam: minimum size limit of 21 cm (which is equal to the length at 50% maturity for all female fish combined). Additionally the regulation or banning of selective fishing methods, such as small-mesh monofilament nets, has been proposed (Taylor and McIlwan 2012). The conservation of L. harak requires the protection of both coral reef and seagrass habitats (Golden et al. 2014).","This species is caught mostly by shore seine, gill nets, traps and handline. It is marketed mostly fresh (Carpenter 2001).In Guam, it has been among the most heavily fished species and is targeted by hook-and-line, gillnet and spear (Hensley and Sherwood 1993).Lethrinids are dominant features of fish landings in many parts of the Pacific. In Oceania, lethrinids are components of reef and lagoon and deep-slope species stocks, and are sometimes taken with small pelagics.Lethrinids are the main targeted reef fish species in Fiji. Commercial hand-line fishing primarily targets lethrinids in Guam in waters less than 150 m.Lethrinids are landed using hand-lines, spears, surrounding nets, and drive-in nets, and occasionally using spears and beach seines (Dalzell et al.1996)."

This species is found to depths of at least 50 m.","Lethrinus lentjan is heavily exploited in the multi-gear, multi-species seagrass and coral reef fisheries in Mombasa, Kenya. Populations in this area exhibited both growth and recruitment overfishing.Lethrinus lentjan was among the three most abundant species which accounted for over 60% of the individuals in the catch. Across all gear types over 90% of the landed L. lentjan were below the length of maturity, with 99.6% of those landed by beach seine being under the length of maturity (Hicks and McClanahan 2012).This species was among the top fivedominatingfish species identified in Chwaka village (near Zanzabar, Tanzania) fish market in both the monsoon and the dry season,contributing 7 to 10% of the observed catch (Torre-Castro et al. 2014).Twenty-six percent of the total catch of fishes in were classified as being juvenile. Eleven percent of the total juveniles caught wereL. lentjan(Unsworthet al. 2014). The modal age of all samples ofL. lentjan, which indicates full recruitment to the common gear configuration used in the Great Barrier Reef line fisheries, was 8 years, which corresponds to 42% of the estimated maximum age of 19 years (Curreyet al. 2013). In Northern Australia this species was common in trawl surveys operating at depths of 55 to 64 m (Ramm and Xiao 1995).The species components of these mixed stocks exhibit variation in lifespan, maximum size, and spawning season. Variations in life history among a suite of species taken in the same fishery are likely to result in different responses to fishing pressure (Curreyet al. 2013).This species is among the most important species taken in handline fisheries in New Caledonia (Kulbickiet al. 2000). It is rare in the Solomon Islands (Green et al. 2006) and a low abundance was reported in the Great Barrier Reef (1994-2014) and has not been recorded in underwater surveys since 2007 (AIMS unpublished data). In the Philippines, this species is very heavily exploited but is still locally abundant and appears commonly in the markets (K. Carpenter pers. comm. 2015); however, often only juveniles are represented in the markets.In the Fiji, the recorded density for this species was 0.1/ha (S. Jupiter, unpublished data).

The maximum recorded total length is 87 cm TL (Assadi and Dehghani1997).Lethrinus nebulosusspawns between April to May (Grandcourtet al.2006, 2010). Longevity is estimatedto be 14-21 years (Mathews and Samuel 1991,Edwards and Shaher 1991,Grandcourt 2006) The mean size at first sexual maturity for females is 27.6 cm (FL) and 28.6 cm (FL)for males (Grandcourtet al.2006).This species is long-lived (20-30 years, although this varies by region) and large-bodied.The species components of these mixed stocks exhibit variation in lifespan, maximum size, and spawning season. Variations in life history among a suite of species taken in the same fishery are likely to result in different responses to fishing pressure. This species and other relatively large-bodied Lethrinidae exhibited right-skewed frequency distributions in the Great Barrier Reef (Curreyet al. 2013).This species is considered to be a relatively large-bodied lethrinid, with maximum L<sub>F</sub>of 64 cm and a large modalL<sub>F</sub>of 46.0 mm (Curreyet al. 2013).This species undergoes a protogynous sex change which occurs over a wide range of year groups starting with age 1, well before maturity (McPhersonet al. 1985).Lifespan of this species is in excess of 20 years (Dalzellet al. 1996).Off the Ryukyu Islands, the age of 50% ovarian maturity was 4 years, and the oldest collected individuals were 26 years old (Ebisawa and Ozawa 2009).

This species was landed primarily by beach seine, but also by fishing line, trap and net. All of the individuals caught by line fishing , 65.4% of the individuals caught by net, 90.3% of the individuals caught by trap, and 62.5% of the individuals caught by spear were below the length at first maturity(Hicks and McClanahan2012).This species is not managed within the bottomfish resource management unit in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. It is considered an 'other bottomfish'. Bottomfish complexes were not depleted and were not experiencing overfishing in 2010. The status of this stock is based on fishery-dependent data, and there are currently no fishery-independent measures of relative or absolute bottom-fish abundance (Brodziaket al. 2012).This species is among the most extensively harvested lethrinid species harvested from reef flats in Guam and elsewhere (Taylor 2010). In Guam, Lethrinids are the largest component of the bottomfish fishery. The relative contribution ofL. obsoletusis currently unknown. Catch-per-unit-effort has declined consistently from the early 1980s until 2008. From 2008 to 2010 CPUE (lbs/hr) values appear to be increasing; however, CPUE in 2010 is 1/2 that of the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s. High early CPUE values may be attributed to relatively unfished bottom areas being more productive. In Guam, Lethrinids have became rare on shallow reefs due to heavy fishing and possibly reef degradation due to natural and human impacts (Greenet al.1997). Emperors are frequently incidental catch in the fishery for small carangids. Lethrinids in Guam have an Annual Catch limit of 38,720 lbs. Coral reef fisheries around Guam have not been determined to be overfished; however, there are no existing stock assessments (WPRFMC 2012).The commercial bottomfish fishery in American Samoa was established from 1982-1985.

The relative contribution ofL. obsoletusto total bottomfish catch is about 1%, however it is likely under-reported or lumped with other emperors. Stock assessment of Bottomfish Management Unit Species (BMUS) indicated below maximum sustainable yield. Decline in bottomfishing catch has occurred with decline in effort in American Samoa. Additionally, declines in adjusted price of fish suggest declining fish consumption. In 2011 this species accounted for 11% of all bottomfish landings (3987 lbs/35,808 lbs). In 2012, Annual Catch Limits were implemented (WPRFMC 2012). Lethrinids, which are caught using various methods, are the dominant catch in the CNMI, sometimes doubling or tripling the next most landed species.Lethrinus rubioperculatusis the most frequently harvested and easily identified species in the shallow-water bottomfish complex. The relative contribution ofL. obsoletusto the catch is unknown. Fishing effort (number of boats and number of trips targeting bottomfish) has declined steadily from 2006 to 2011. Commercial landings of Lethrids show large fluctuations from 1983 to 2011, and have particularly fluctuated over the last 8 years. Catch-per-unit-effort (lbs per hour) has fluctuated from 2000 to 2011, with a slight decreasing trend. Catch-per-unit effort has declined consistently in the snorkel spear fishery from a series high of 3.5lbs/hour in 2000 to a series low of less than 0.25lbs/hour 2011. Bottomfish stocks are not experiencing overfishing although there are no species-specific stock assessments available (WPRFMC 2012).From 2008-2014, regional estimates of the density of L. obsoletus ranged from 0.2-1.0 individuals per hectare over hard bottoms to 30 m depth in Pacific coral reef areas surveyed by NOAA (NOAA unpublished data in Heenanet al.2014). The highest density was in the Southern Marianas Island region (0-3.2 individuals per hectare) as compared to the lowest, in the Samoa region (0-0.6 individuals). The species was not recorded in the Hawaiian Islands or the US Line and Phoenix Islands (NOAA unpublished data as described in Heenan and Williams 2014)Data from Timor Leste NOAA surveys (2008-2014) showed a density of 0.7/ha(NOAA unpublished data as described in Heenan et al. 2014).

The highest density was in the Southern Mariana Island region (0-4 individuals per hectare) as compared to the lowest, in the Samoa region (0-0.07 individuals).The species was not recorded in the Hawaiian Islands (NOAA unpublisheddata as describedin Heenanet al.2014).In the Solomon Islands, surveys around the populous islands showed a mean density of 0.4 /ha and surveys around the remote islands showed a mean density of 4.9 /ha (A. Green, unpublished data).  American Samoa The commercial bottomfish fishery in American Samoa was established from 1982-1985. Of all bottomfish species landed in American Samoa L. rubioperculatus and other emperors, Etelis corruscans and Lutjanus kasmira are the top landings in pounds comprising about 77% of total landings. Stock assessment of Bottomfish Management Unit Species (BMUS) indicated below maximum sustainable yield. Decline in bottomfishing catch has occurred with decline in effort in American Samoa. Additionally, declines in adjusted price of fish suggest declining fish consumption. In 2011 this species accounted for 11% of all bottomfish landings (3987 lbs/35808 lbs) (WPRFMC 2012). Guam In Guam, Lethrinids are the largest component of the bottomfish fishery. Catch-per-unit-effort has declined consistently from the early 1980s until 2008. From 2008 to 2010 CPUE (lbs/hr) values appear to be increasing; however, CPUE in 2010 is 1/2 that of the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s. High early CPUE values may be attributed to relatively unfished bottom areas being more productive . In Guam, Lethrinids have became rare on shallow reefs due to heavy fishing and possibly reef degradation due to natural and human impacts (Green et al.1997). Emperors are frequently incidental catch in the fishery for small carangids. Lethrinids in Guam have an Annual Catch limit of 38,720 lbs. Coral reef fisheries around Guam have not been determined to be overfished however there are no existing stock assessments (WPRFMC 2012). Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Lethrinids, which are caught using various methods, are the dominant catch in the CNMI, sometimes doubling or tripling the next most landed species. Lethrinus rubioperculatus is the most frequently harvested and easily identified species in the shallow-water bottomfish complex. Fishing effort (number of boats and number of trips targeting bottomfish) has declined steadily from 2006 to 2011, while catch rate has remained relatively Commercial landings of Lethrids show large fluctuations from 1983 to 2011, and have particularly fluctuated over the last 8 years. Catch-per-unit-effort (lbs per hour) has fluctuated from 2000 to 2011, with a slight decreasing trend. Catch-per-unit effort has declined consistently in the snorkel spear fishery from a series high of 3.5 lbs/hour in 2000 to a series low of less than 0.25 lbs/hour 2011. Bottomfish stocks are not experiencing overfishing although there are no species-specific stock assessments available (WPRFMC 2012).Rates of stock decline in Okinawa Island waters have been relatively small (Ebisawa and Ozawa 2009).This species is heavily exploited in the Philippines, but is still common in markets (K. Carpenter pers. comm. 2015).",unknown,"Lethrinus rubrioperculatusinhabits sand and rubble areas of outer reef slopes to depths of 160 m. This species feeds mostly on crustaceans, fishes, echinoderms, and molluscs. It reaches a maximum reported total length of 50 cm; however, it is commonly seen to 30 cm (Carpenter 2001). This species is a mesocarnivore which stalks relatively high-speed prey such as fishes and crustaceans (Galbo et al. 2002). It is often found in large schools and prefers hard bottoms under oceanic influences such as reef slopes and offshore banks and reefs (Ebisawa 1997, Hanoomanjee and Soondron 1999, Trianni 2011). In the waters off Okinawa and Yaeyama the spawning period of this species extended from April to December. Sexual maturation started at about 20 cm FL, and was complete in females at 26 cm FL.Off the Ryukyu Islands, the age of 50% ovarian maturity was 1-2 years (Ebisawa and Ozawa 2009).Spawning intervals were estimated at between 1.0 and 1.52 days from May to October. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite. The smallest male and largest female observed off Okinawa were 26.4 cm and 41.9 cm, respectively (Ebisawa 1997). In the Northern Mariana Islands commercial fishery the oldest individual sampled was 8 years old, length at maturity corresponded to age 1, length at transition corresponded to age 3-4. Most individuals in the South Southern Islands were 0-2 years old, while most in the North Southern Islands were 1-4 years old (Trianni 2011).","This species is a component of fisheries throughout its range, but this does not appear to be a major threat at the global level.","This species' range is overlaps with marine protected areas.It is included in the Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fishery Management Plan in Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and other uninhabited US Pacific Islands. Measures include the prohibition of some destructive fishing practices and allows for regulatory adjustments such as catch limits, size limits, area or seasonal closures, fishing effort limitations, fishing gear restrictions, access limitations, permit and/or catch reporting requirements. In 2006, an ecosystem-based management approach was adopted by the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC 2012).","This species is an excellent food fish.

A peak of 0.9 tonnes was collected in 2012(Annual Fisheries Statistics Report for Abu Dhabi Emirate 2010-2012).",unknown,"Lutjanus argentimaculatus is an oceanodromous, reef-associated species. Juveniles and young adults occur in mangrove estuaries, as well as the lower reaches of freshwater streams and tidal creeks (Sommer et al. 1996 ). Adults are often found in groups around coral reefs (Lieske and Myers 1994) and eventually migrate offshore to deeper reef areas, sometimes penetrating to depths in excess of 100 m. Females are generally larger than males of the same age (Russell et al. 2003). This nocturnal species feeds mostly on fishes and crustaceans. This is an important market species throughout the Indo-Pacific region (Anderson and Allen 2001). Longevity is estimated to be 37 years (Grandcourtet al.2013). Spawning occurs off the coast of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi from September to October (Grandcourtet al.2013). The annual average fecundity is 4 million eggs (Russell et al. 2003). The mean age and size at first sexual maturity for female Lutjanus aregentimaculatus are 14.0 and 56.4 cm FL, respectively, while males reach first sexual maturity at 13.0 yrs and 55.8 cm FL, respectively (Grandcourt et al. 2013).

In addition, in some areas (e.g., the Persian Gulf),the habitat for juveniles for this species has been seriously degraded. The juveniles depend on mangroves, which have been destroyed for coastal development projects, and depend on some amount of fresh water (inhabit brakish water), which is decreasing. However, we are lacking quantitative data that indicates the Gulf serves as a nursery area for juveniles (Grandcourt et al. 2013).This species is utilized for commercial aquaculturein Pakistan, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines (Emata 1996, Emataet al.1999, Hong and Zhang 2002).","This species was listed as Least Concern in the Gulf (IUCN 2015). There are a number of marine protected areas that intersect with the range of L. argentimaculatus (IUCN UNEP 2014).

The stock of this species in Queensland, Western Australia and Northern Territory, Australia are considered to be 'sustainable' and not over-fished. In addition, the current harvest rate is well below maximum sustainable yield (Martin et al. 2014, Northern Territory Government 2015). The intensity of fishing effort and catch of this species in Indonesia is expected to be an order of magnitude greater than in Australia partly due to its higher market value there, but little quantitative data are available to determine population trends (Salini et al. 2006). Indonesian snapper fisheries have been expanding since about 1990 (Blaber et al. 2005). According to genetics studies by Salini et al. (2006), the populations in Indonesia and Australia are separate.

It is considered an excellent food fish and appears regularly in markets, but usually in small quantities. It is targeted alongside L.malabaricus by commercial and recreational fisheries of Australia (Martin et al. 2014). It is also exploited in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia by commercial, artisanal and recreational fishers, and some portion of the catch is exported for sale in international markets (Blaber et al. 2005, Salini et al. 2006). This species is caught in the artisanal snapper fisheries of the Gulf of Mannar and West Bengal in India (Barman et al. 2013, Murugan et al. 2014).

During the two fishing season,39.145and 92.704 kg ofLutjanus johniiwere collected as by-catch, which comprised of 0.236 and 0.703% of the total catch, respectively. CPUE was determined to be 0.376 and 0.594 kg/h (Paighambari and Daliri 2012).FAO RECOFI aggregate landings shows an overall increasing, but fluctuating trend from 1,166 tonnes in 1997 to 1,432 tonnes in 2011. A peak of 1,788 tonnes were collected in 2010 (FAO 2013).According to the Sea Around Us Project, Pauly and Zeller (2015) estimate that between 1990 and 2004, reported, global landings of this species increased from 2,500 to about 10,000 tonnes; however, they approximate that in 1990, nearly 9,500 unreported tonnes were landed globally and 22,000 unreported tonnes were landed globally in 2004.",unknown,"This is a reef-associated, oceanodromous species. Adults probably frequent coral reef areas, and juveniles are found in mangrove swamps and estuaries (Allen 1985,Kiso and Mahyam 2003). This species feeds on fishes and benthic invertebrates including shrimps, crabs and cephalopods. Spawning has been reported during September in the Andaman Sea (Anderson and Allen 2001). This species was more abundant over deep reefs than over shallow reefs (Travers et al. 2006). In Australia this species is a dominant, large Lutjanid of the nearshore community of reef fishes. Large adults in Australia are found schooling in turbid waters around hard substrata in muddy coastal areas and occasionally on sandy trawl grounds offshore (Marriott and Cappo 2000). This species reaches a maximum total length of 97 cm (IGFA 2001).The maximum age ofL. johnii, expressed as mean age in published literature, is 11.4 years. The age of maturity is 3.2 years, the reproductive lifespan (RLS) is estimated at 11.4 years, and the natural mortality is 0.52 (Martinez-Andrade 2003). Additional aging of sectioned otoliths from northern Australia revealed a maximum age of 28 years in north Queensland (Cappo et al. 2012).In the Persian Gulf longevity is estimated at 17 years, L infinity 89 cm, and growth parameters k = 0.165 and length at maturity (44 cm) (Kamalie et al. 2006).","This species is caught mainly with handlines, bottom longlines, traps, and bottom trawls. In Hong Kong, this species is found in live fish markets (Lee and Sadovy 1998).This species is utilized for commercial aquaculturein Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines (Hussain and Khatoon 2000).","This species is found in marine protected areas throughout its range (IUCN and UNEP 2014).This species was assessed at Least Concern in the Persian Gulf region. In the Northern Territory of Australia, this species has aminimum size restriction and possession limits under the Coral Reef Fin Fish management plan.

It is commercially important in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea (Sadighzadeh et al. 2014).However, this species is poorly documented and may be confused with other black spot snappers. Thus better species-specific discrimination in the catch statistics is needed (G. Allen pers. comm. 2013).

This species is a component of mixed-species fisheries throughout its range, and is the most abundant component of the catch in some areas. Longevity is at least 10 years, while age of maturity is 3 years. Lutjanus kasmira is managed to varying degrees throughout its range, and is also found in marine protected areas.

This species is typically found to depths of at least 60 m, although it has been reported to depths of 265 m(Anderson and Allen 2001, Randall 2005).","This species is common and can be locally abundant. For example, atRéunion Island this species is highly-abundant (Mabloukéet al. 2013) and in American Samoa, this species had the highest overall catch (Luck and Dalzell 2010).In the Kalimani Wildlife Management Area, Papua New Guinea, the mean fork length of 4 specimens was 33 cm, which is 133% of the estimated length of female maturity (12 cm), and 48% of the maximum length (33 cm) (Longeneckeret al. 2014).The majority (89.5%) of theL. kasmirataken inthe multi-gear fishery of southern Kenya were well below lengths of first maturity. The length at first capture was 12 cm, while the length at maturity was 17.49 cm. This species was not very abundant in the fishery (Mangi and Roberts 2006).This species is managed within the shallow-water component of the bottomfish resource management unit in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. Bottomfish complexes were not depleted and were not experiencing overfishing in 2010. The status of this stock is based on fishery-dependent data, and there are currently no fishery-independent measures of relative or absolute bottomfish abundance (Brodziaket al. 2012).From 2008 to 2014, regional estimates of the density of L. kasmira ranged from 7.7 to 166.2 individuals per hectare over hard bottoms to 30 m depth in Pacific coral reef areas surveyed by NOAA (NOAA unpublished data as described in Heenan et al. 2014). The highest density was in the Main Hawaiian Islands region (4.1 to 329.6 individuals per hectare) as compared to the lowest, in the Southern Mariana Islands region (0 to 16.9 individuals).In fisheries independent fish density surveys conducted by NOAA between 2008 and 2012, L. kasmira had a mean density of 3.04/ha off Fiji (S. Jupiter unpublished data), Lamotrek, Federated States of Micronesia had a mean density of 1.7/ha (B. Taylor unpublished data) and Raja Ampat had a mean density of 0.2/ha (A. Green unpublished data). Allen (2006) reported that this species is occasionally observed in low numbers in the Solomon Islands.Lutjanus kasmirawas introduced to Hawaii roughly 40 years ago from French Polynesia, where it has undergone a population explosion that is believed to be at the expense of species of greater commercial value (Randall 2005). It has adapted quickly and successfully in this region, spread rapidly throughout the archipelago and over a large range of depths. Although some concern regarding the effect of this introduced species on native snappers has been expressed, research has shown that, as an adult, this species shows little aggression towards native snappers, does not share the same depth and feeding habitat with most native species, overlaps little in diet, and is not a frequent predator or prey of native species (Parrish et al. 2000). However, other sources claim this species forms 'marauding schools' which feed on the eggs, larvae, and small adult native fishes and feeds voraciously on crabs and polychaetes (Friedlander 2004).Snappers make up 45% of the bottomfish harvest in the western Pacific, and total snapper harvests increased by 6% from 2004 to 2005. Boat-based fishing methods account for 98% of the total catch. In 2005 this species accounted for 0.01% of all fish landed in the Bottomfish and Seamount Groundfish Fishery by weight (479lbs L. kasmira, 61,601 lbs total) although it is not always identified to the species-level. The 2005 CPUE values from boat-based bottom fishing, the total, non-charter and charters increased 53% (2.3 lbs/hr from 1.5 lbs/hr), increased 56% (2.5 lbs/hr from 1.6 lbs/hr) and increased 150% (0.5 lbs/hr from 0.2 lbs/hr) from the 2004 values. Average sizes for L. kasmira decreased 5% and fell below the average for a 24-year time series (WPRFMC 2005).",unknown,"This species inhabits coral reefs, occurring in both shallow lagoons and on outer reef slopes to depths of at least 60 m (Allen 1985), but occurs to depths of 180 and 265 m at the Marquesas Islands and Red Sea. They are frequently found in large aggregations around coral formation, scaves or wrecks during the day. Juveniles inhabit estuarine seagrass beds around patch reefs (Lieske and Myers 1994). Larger Lutjanus kasmira were reported to occur on shallow reef slopes while smaller individuals inhabit deeper slopes and tongue-and-groove habitats (Friedlander et al. 2002). They feed on fishes, shrimps, crabs, stomatopods, cephalopods, and planktonic crustaceans. This species also takes a variety of algae (Bagnis et al. 1972).This species was found to display high site-fidelity. Large aggregations of L. kasmira in French Polynesia were formed predominantly by resident individuals with limited local movement, including at night (Vignon et al. 2008).Spawning occurs throughout most of the year in lower latitudes with peak activity reported for November and December in the Andaman Sea. Eggs measure from 0.78 to 0.85 mm in diameter and hatch in about 18 hours at 22° to 25° C (Allen 1985).The maximum age ofL. kasmira, expressed as mean age in published literature, is 10.2 years. The age of maturity is 3.2 years, the reproductive lifespan (RLS) is estimated at 8 years, and the natural mortality is 0.83 (Martinez-Andrade 2003).The largest specimen reported is around 40 cm total length (Bykov 1983).","This species is caught mainly with handlines, traps, and gill nets.

The intensity of fishing effort and catch of this species in Indonesia is expected to be an order of magnitude greater than in Australia partly due to its higher market value there, but little quantitative data are available to determine population trends (Saliniet al.2006). Indonesian snapper fisheries have been expanding since about 1990 (Blaberet al.2005).

Lutjanus sebae becomes vulnerable to fishing gear at a mean size and age before the attainment of sexual maturity at 62 cm, and the fishery is highlighted as one needing urgent attention. Production potential of this species has likely been overestimated in the past which highlights the importance of incorporating age-based demographic parameters in stock assessments for relatively long-lived, slow growing tropical species.Up to 65.7% of yields in the fishery in 2004 were individuals under the mean size at which sexual maturity is achieved(Grandcourtet al. 2008). Analysis of otolith stable isotopes indicates that the Emperor red snapper comprises a number of separate biological stocks in the North Coast Bioregion/Western Australia, which is the primary area of exploitation for this species -one in Kimberley, one in the Pilbara and the third in Gascoyne. Stock status was considered sustainable in this area. The stock status is Undefined in the Northern Territory and Queensland (Flood et al. 2014).In the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery (NDSF) within the Kimberly region of Western Australia, L. sebae has comprised on average 23.6% of the total landed catch of demersal scalefish from 1995 through 1999, ca. 160 metric tonnes per year (Newman and Dunk 2002).

Juveniles less than 20 cm long are common in mangrove areas (Allen 1985) in near shore, turbid waters, or among both coastal and deeper water offshore reefs (Williams and Russ 1992). They move to deeper waters as they grow larger (McPherson et al. 1988), with large fish often moving into shallower water during the winter months (Williams and Russ 1992, McPherson et al. 1988). They form schools of similar-sized individuals or are solitary (Kailola et al. 1993) and are frequently commensal with sea urchins (Allen 1985).This species feeds on fishes, crabs, stomatopods, other benthic crustaceans and cephalopods (Anderson and Allen 2001).

East Africa and Western Indian Ocean In the Kalimani Wildlife Management Area, Papua New Guinea, the mean fork length of 76 specimens was 24 cm and decreased from 2013 to 2014. This is 67% of the estimated length of female maturity (36 cm), and 43% of the maximum length (56 cm)(Longenecker et al. 2014).All of theM. grandoculistaken inthe multi-gear fishery of southern Kenya were well below lengths of first maturity. The length at first capture was 19.2 cm, while the length at maturity was 31.8 cm. This species was not very abundant in the fishery (Mangi and Roberts 2006). Oceania This species is not managed within the bottomfish resource management unit in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam. It is considered an 'other bottomfish'. Bottomfish complexes were not depleted and were not experiencing overfishing in 2010. The status of this stock is based on fishery-dependent data, and there are currently no fishery-independent measures of relative or absolute bottom-fish abundance (Brodziaket al. 2012). Abundant and most common lethrinid in Solomon Islands (Allen 2006).In Fiji, all of the individuals (n=9) either landed, sold or consumed were below the minimum length at maturity (Cakacakaet al.2010).This species was the 9th most common species in the coral reef fishery of Pohnpei, Micronesia (Rhodeset al. 2008). American Samoa The commercial bottomfish fishery in American Samoa was established from 1982-1985. Of all bottomfish species landed in American SamoaL. rubioperculatusand other emperors,Etelis corruscansandLutjanus kasmiraare the top landings in pounds comprising about 77% of total landings. The relative contribution of M. grandoculisto the catch is currently unknown. Stock assessment of Bottomfish Management Unit Species (BMUS) indicated below maximum sustainable yield. Decline in bottomfishing catch has occurred with decline in effort in American Samoa. Additionally, declines in adjusted price of fish suggest declining fish consumption. In 2011, this species accounted for 11% of all bottomfish landings (3987 lbs/35,808 lbs). In 2012 Annual Catch Limits were implemented (WPRFMC 2012). Guam This species is among the most extensivelyharvestedlethrinids from reef flats in Guam and elsewhere (Taylor 2010). In Guam, Lethrinids are the largest component of the bottomfish fishery. The relative contribution of M. grandoculisis currently unknown. Catch-per-unit-effort has declined consistently from the early 1980s until 2008. From 2008 to 2010, CPUE (lbs/hr) values appear to be increasing; however, CPUE in 2010 is half that of the mid-late 1980s and early 1990s. High early CPUE values may be attributed to relatively unfished bottom areas being more productive. In Guam, Lethrinids have became rare on shallow reefs due to heavy fishing and possibly reef degradation due to natural and human impacts (Green et al.1997). Emperors are frequently incidental catch in the fishery for small carangids. Coral reef fisheries around Guam have not been determined to be overfished, however, there are no existing stock assessments (WPRFMC 2012). Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Lethrinids, which are caught using various methods, are the dominant catch in the CNMI, sometimes doubling or tripling the next most landed species.Fishing effort (number of boats and number of trips targeting bottomfish) has declined steadily from 2006 to 2011. Commercial landings of Lethrinids show large fluctuations from 1983 to 2011, and have fluctuated over the last 8 years. Catch-per-unit-effort (lbs per hour) has fluctuated from 2000 to 2011, with a slight decreasing trend. Bottomfish stocks are not experiencing overfishing although there are no species-specific stock assessments available (WPRFMC 2012). Australia The modal age of all samples ofM. grandoculis, which indicates full recruitment to the common gear configuration used in Great Barrier Reef line fisheries, was three years, which corresponds to 20% of the estimated maximum age of 15 years. This species and other relatively large-bodied lethrinidae exhibited right-skewed frequency distributions. Very few specimens older than five years were sampled in the Great Barrier Reef (Curreyet al. 2013). This species is a minor component of the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery in the Great Barrier Reef and is primarily taken by charter vessels rather than the commercial sector (Curreyet al. 2010). Visual census among three mid-continental shelf reefs revealed significant temporal variation in the abundance of this species with counts being significantly higher in July than in September, February and May (Newman and Williams 2001). Southeast Asia In the Philippines, this species used to be locally abundant. However, it has been overexploited and now is not as common (K. Carpenter pers. comm. 2015).",unknown,"Monotaxis grandoculis is usually found on coral reefs, often on the sandy periphery or in sand and rubble areas. Solitary individuals are often encountered, but large adults frequently form aggregations of up to about 50 individuals. The depths range of this species is between 3 and 60 m, although it appears to be most common between about 5 to 30 m. This species consumes mainly gastropod molluscs, ophiuroids and echinoids as well as pagurid and brachyuran crabs, polychaetes, tunicates and holothurians. It reaches a maximum size of 60 cm total length (TL); however, it is commonly seen to 40 cm TL (Carpenter 2001).","This species is fished throughout its range, but this does not currently appear to be a major threat at the global level.",There are no known species-specific conservation measures.,"This species caught mainly with gill nets, traps, spears and handlines. It is marketed fresh. Sometimes this species is ciguatoxic in the Marshall Islands (Carpenter 2001). Lethrinids are dominant features of fish landings in many parts of the Pacific. In Oceania, lethrinids are components of reef and lagoon and deep-slope species stocks, and are sometimes taken with small pelagics.Lethrinids are the main targeted reef fish species in Fiji. Commercial hand-line fishing primarily targets lethrinids in Guam in waters less than 150 m (Dalzell et al.1996).Lethrinids are landed using hand-lines, spears, surrounding nets, and drive-in nets, and occasionally using spears and beach seines."

It is also known to occur around and within mangrove forests, which may be used as nursery grounds. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and demersal trawl. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality; and mangroves from deforestation and coastal development. While there is limited species-specific data available, it is likely to have undergone declines based on its large size and presumably low productivity, and intensive coastal fisheries through much of its range. Landings surveys, dive surveys, diver interviews, and anecdotal evidence indicate substantial declines over the past three generations lengths (50 years). Results from baited remote underwater video system surveys of coral reefs across its range (242 reefs in 36 nations) indicate that the species has declined to very low levels through much of its range in Asia and Africa, but remains common in Australia, and in some island nations of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is estimated that the Sharptooth Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50–79% over the last three generation lengths (50 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark is widespread in coastal waters of the tropical and subtropical Indian and Northwest, Western Central, and Eastern Central Pacific Oceans (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was observed in a global baited remote underwater video system (BRUV) survey of global coral reefs (FinPrint 2020). The survey deployed 11,211 video units on 242 reefs in 36 nations throughout the geographic range of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark (MacNeil et al. 2020). The species was not observed in sufficient numbers to quantitatively estimate levels of population reduction, however, it was regularly observed in Australia, and some island nations in the Western Pacific (e.g., French Polynesia, Palau) and Indian (e.g., Seychelles) Oceans (C.A. Simpfendorfer unpubl. data 2020). In these areas, its population appears to have remained stable. However, along the continental margins of Asia and Africa, and some parts of the Pacific this species was rarely observed, suggesting that populations have declined substantially in those areas.Market surveys at landing sites in Indonesia (e.g., White 2007, Winter et al. 2020) since the mid-1990s have only recorded this species in small amounts, suggesting that it has undergone substantial decline. A similar situation exists in the Philippines (<span style=''>Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017) and Thailand (Arunrugstichai et al. 2018) where it is only occasionally recorded at landing sites. In other nations (e.g<span style=''>. Bangladesh - A.B. Haque unpubl. data 2020; Mynamar - Howard et al. 2015; Malaysia - A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020), it is known from historic records, but has not been observed in recent surveys of landing sites.In the Arabian Seas region, the Sharptooth Lemon Shark represented &lt;1% of landings by number in the Red Sea (Yemen, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia) (Bonfil 2003,Spaet and Berumen 2015). This species was not observed in recent BRUV surveys or underwater visual surveys in this area (Kattan 2014, Spaet et al. 2016).Divers in the Red Sea have reported significant declines over the past 30–40 years (J.L.Y. Spaet pers. comm. 06 February 2017). In the Gulf, this species appears to be uncommon with only one historical record reported in Saudi Arabia (Basson et al. 1977). More recently, the species was not recorded from landing site surveys in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013). However, the species represented0.33% of shark landings by number in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and 0.6% of sharks by number traded through the UAE from Oman (Jabadoet al.2015, Jabadoet al. 2016). Marshall and Barnett (1997) reported this species as being one of the most commonly landed species in Somalia shark fisheries. It is reportedly uncommon in fisheries in Oman, India and the Maldives with no catch data available (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Henderson et al. 2007,Jabadoet al.2015,T. Al Mamari, M. Khan, and K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 06 February 2017). In Pakistan, it used to caught in large quantities using live baits, however, there has been an ~90 % decrease in catches in recent years (M. Khan pers. comm. 12 December 2020).Reports indicate that shark resources in the Red Sea, particularly off Sudan, Djibouti, Yemen (including the Socotra Archipelago), and Somalia were already showing signs of depletion over 15 years ago (PERSGA 2002, Glaser et al. 2015). Shark catches in Sri Lanka decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001, despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). Furthermore, reports from India indicate that several shark stocks are either declining or have already collapsed (Mohamed and Veena 2016).In Australia, this species is regularly caught in small amounts as a non-target species in gillnet fisheries in the north of the country (e.g. Harry et al. 2011). Catch levels have not caused the decline of the species, and it is considered to be sustainably fished (<span style=''>Simpfendorfer et al. 2019).The interpretation of the level of global population reduction is complicated by the divergent state of this species between island (limited population reduction) and continental margin (large population reductions) portions of its range. However, it is no longer observed in many parts of its range and this large area across which it has declined, compared to the habitat area available in small island nations and northern Australia where it remains healthy and thus has some refuge from fishing, suggests that the overall level of population reduction is likely to be large. Thus, the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50-79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years).",decreasing,"The Sharptooth Lemon Sharkis demersal in shallow inshore and offshore waters at depths to at least 90 m and is often found on and around coral reefs and on sandy plateaus near coral (Stevens 1984, Compagno 1998, Ebert et al. 2013). It is also known to occur around and within the mangrove forests in certain areas, which may be used as nursery grounds (Bonfil 2003). It reaches a maximum size of 340 cm total length (TL), males and females mature at 220–240 cm TL (Compagno et al. 2005, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 6-12 pups (average 9.3), a biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 60 cm TL. The generation length is suspected to be around 16.5 years, similar to that of the Lemon Shark (Negaprion brevirostris) which reaches a similarmaximumsize (Brown and Gruber 1988).","The Sharptooth Lemon Shark is caught throughout much of its range in industrial and small-scale longline, gillnet, trawl, and handline fisheries that occur in coastal waters, including around coral reefs and mangrove habitats. It is retained for the meat and fins where possible. There is little data available on the capture of this species in fisheries of island nations in the Pacific Ocean where the species show little trend in population size. Throughout the coastal waters of Asia, it is caught in gillnets, longlines, trawls and handlines and landed. However, in recent years it has rarely been reported in surveys of landings sites. For example, Winter et al. (2020) reported a single individual in landings at Muncar in Indonesia in a 9 month period in 2017–2018. Similar levels of paucity of catch are reported in Thailand (Arunrugstichai et al. 2018), Philippines (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017) and Sri Lanka (Dissanayake 2005). In the Arabian Seas region, there is little species-specific data onSharptooth Lemon Shark catch but generally, carcharhinids there are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (e.g., De Silva 2006, Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example, in the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner et al. 2011).In Australia, this species is caught in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in northern waters. For example, Harry et al. (2011) reported that it made up 0.3% of the gillnet catch (in numbers) in Queensland. It is taken in the North Prawn Fishery, with estimates of fishing mortality below those that would lead to population decline (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It is also captured in small amounts in the North Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery, and Western Australia Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery (Simpfendorfer et al. 2019). The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was identified as a minor component of the large and prevalent Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU) in northern Australian waters during the early 2000s (Field et al. 2009, Marshall 2011). However, the IUU fishing has declined significantly since 2006 due to increased border surveillance, international agreements, and possibly increased fuel prices and reduction in target shark species (Field et al. 2009, Haward and Bergin 2016).The reliance of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil et al. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.The reliance of this species on mangrove habitats, especially as pupping and nursery grounds makes them susceptible to declines in habitat quality. The extent of mangrove habitat has declined markedly, with 20-35% of areas lost during the last half of the 20th century (Polidoro et al. 2010) as a result of coastal development for urbanisation, aquaculture and agriculture, timber harvesting sand resource extraction (Goldberg et al. 2020).","There are few species-specific regulations in place to protect this species. In northern Australia, fisheries that target sharks are managed using output (i.e., effort controls) and/or Total Allowable Catches (Queensland) or Individual Transferable Quotas (Northern Territory). These catch limits are not species-specific, but are for sharks or subsets of shark species. There are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species in many range states. Marine Protected Areas are common in coral reef areas throughout its range, but only those that are sufficiently large and well enforced provide refuge for reef associated sharks (MacNeil et al. 2020). Shark sanctuaries, where targeted shark fishing is banned within a nations entire Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), provide benefits to reef sharks (MacNeil et al. 2020) and cover significant parts of the range, especially in the Pacific (e.g., French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Palau). To conserve the population and to permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required which may include species protection, spatial management, bycatch mitigation, and harvest and trade management measures (including international trade measures). The use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) has been shown to be an effective way to reduce the catches of large sharks in prawn and shrimp trawls (Campbell et al. 2020). Effective enforcement of measures will require ongoing training and capacity-building (including in the area of species identification). Catch monitoring is needed to help understand population trends and inform management.","The meat of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is used fresh, dried, salted, frozen, or smoked. Fields et al. (2018) reported that Sharptooth Lemon Shark made up 0.6% of fin trimmings sold in Hong Kong. The species is occasionally displayed in aquaria. In the Western and Central Pacific, the species is a key component of the tourism industry where diving and interactions with this shark regularly occur. It is estimated that the species generates around USD 5.4 million USD per year within a shark feeding ecotourism operation in French Polynesia (Clua et al.2011)."

In addition, the abundance of the species based on expert fishers knowledge dating back to the 1950swas estimated to have declined by up to 80% (Irogyen and Trobbiani 2016).

These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort.

In Japan, some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates from 1969–2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches were minimalduring 1950, then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t, followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014(Zeller and Pauly 2016).Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara et al. 2011). When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (65 years) they represent declines of 99%, 67%, 99%, and 53% in Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Based on suspected declines in part of its range (south Atlantic, Northwest Pacific) and increasing trends in the Southwest Pacific, high levels of exploitation across most of the species' range, and a precautionary approach regarding the potential for separate subpopulations, a global population reduction of 30–49% was suspected over three generation lengths (65 years).

For example, 97 individuals were reported from a single overnight gillnet fishing operation in Samborombón Bay, Argentina (De Wysiecki et al. 2018).

Records from the Western Indian Ocean may refer to a new, undescribed species. Otolithes ruber is considered common throughout much of its range. It is taken in mixed-species fisheries in many areas. There are localized reports of overfishing in some areas but the fisheries are not thought to be causing global population declines at this time that meet the criteria for a threatened category. Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern. Further research on the taxonomy of this species is needed.","Otolithes ruber is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacificfrom India to southern China and Taiwan, and south to Australia (Carpenter et al. 1997; Sasaki 1996, 2001; Larson et al. 2013).In China, this species is mainly distributed in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, but in very low abundance (J.-H. Cheng pers. comm. 2009). Records ofO. ruberfrom the western Indian Ocean (e.g., from western India to South Africa) may refer to an undescribed species (Sasaki 2001, Zemleket al. 2009). The depth range for this species is 3-100 m.","Population data are limited for this species but it is likely to be common throughout most of its range. Navaluna (1982) showed that total mortality in the Philippine trawl fishery had increased remarkably since the 1960s. A yield-per-recruit analysis was performed which showed that the stock in San Miguel Bay was overfished.This species is caught all along the coast of India and is the most abundant sciaenid along the Kerala and the Maharastra coasts (Talwar and Kacker 1984).There is a large fishery for this species in India, particularly in Gujarat; annual Indian landings averaged around 5,000 mt from 2007-2018, declining to ca. 1,400 mt in 2018 (R. Nair pers. comm. 2019). Evidence suggests that there are potentially three stocks of O. ruberoff the coast of India with one off the west and two off the east coast (Chhandaprajnadarsini et al.2019).There are limited discontinuous research trawl catch data (mostly unpublished) for South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Madagascar e.g. it was most abundant in shallow (&lt;50 m) trawls off Kenya and Tanzania, respectively (Kaunda-Arara et al. 2016), and one of the most abundant fish in shallow trawls off the east coast of South Africa (Fennessy et al. 1994) and central Mozambique (Fennessy and Isaksen 2007). In South African east coast shallow-water observed prawn trawl catches from 1989-92, this species comprised 14% by no. of bycatch fishes and occurred in 98% of trawls, while in 2003-2006 it comprised 22% by no. and occurred in 100% of observed trawls (Fennessy, unpubl. data). A spawning biomass per recruit (SBPR) assessment of trawled O. ruber from South Africa based on information collected from 1989 – 1992 indicated that the species was over-fished at that time, with SBPR levels at 33% of the unfished level. Subsequent changes in the fishery, including seasonal closures and an increase in mesh size, are likely to have improved the SBPR levels of this species (Olbers and Fennessy 2007). In central Mozambique, research trawl catch rates of O. ruber remained similar from the period 1975-1990 to the period 2007-2014 (Fennessy et al. 2017). Schultz (1992) showed that this species was over-exploited by prawn trawlers in Mozambique. There have been recent increased levels of industrial-scale fish trawling in Mozambique, but catches and effort are not known (S. Fennessy pers. comm.).",unknown,"Otolithes ruber is found in benthopelagic, brackish, and marine habitats at a depth range of 3-100 m, over sandy, muddy and rocky bottoms. Young fish feed mainly at the surface on planktonic crustaceans such as Acetes and mysids, and adults feed on benthic crustaceans, worms, molluscs, and fishes.It is commonly reported to 40 cm. Age at 50% maturity is reached at 1.7 years (Olbers and Fennessy 2007) at a length of 23.7 cm (Fennessy 2000). Additional information about its life span is needed but in South Africa it is reported to live to at least 8 years, and with a maximum length of 48.5 cm (Brash and Fennessy 2005).There have been numerous studies on its general biology and ecology (e.g. Azhir 2008, Azhir et al. 2007, Blaber 1980, Dadzie 2007, Iqbal 1995, Jayasankar 1990, Passoupathy and Natarajan 1986).","This species is a component of mixed-species fisheries using a wide variety of gears throughout its range and as a bycatch in prawn-directed trawl fisheries. Small-scale (artisanal/subsistence) fishing occurs extensively throughout the range of this species. There are localized indications of overfishing in some areas (e.g., Philippines, Thailand, South Africa, Mozambique); however, the fisheries are not thought to be causing global population declines at this time.In the Gulf of Thailand, the primary threats to this species is overfishing and degradation of coastal environment due to urbanization; ontogeny studies are lacking and there is no management plan.The species prefers turbid waters, and if planned dams on the large Thukela River in South Africa are built, with consequent reduced offshore turbidity, muddy sediment and nutrients, the area of suitable offshore habitat could be compromised (Fennessy et al. 2016, de Lecea et al. 2016). Dams planned on similar systems elsewhere in the range of this species pose a similar threat.","There are no species-specific conservation efforts in place for this species. However, in South and East China Seas, mainland China, the fishing moratorium for trawlers between May and August may be able to provide some protection for this species. Madagascar and Mozambique have a 6-month closed season on their shallow-water prawn trawl grounds which is aimed at optimizing prawn catches but which also helps reduce total by-catch, including O. ruber. In August 2019 a large offshore MPA (the Thukela MPA) was declared in South Africa, which will exclude shallow-water trawling from the habitat where this species is most abundant in South Africa.It is also known from Kakadu National Park, Australia (NTM records).","This species is taken in mixed-species fisheries throughout its range, and as bycatch in prawn trawl fisheries in the western Indian Ocean (e.g. Fennessy et al. 2004, Chen et al. 2013). Various gears are used including gillnets, trawls, push nets, beach seines, hook and line, and bottom set long lines (M. Santos pers. comm. 2016). It is typically marketed fresh or dried and salted, and can fetch up to NTD300/kg (H.-M. Yeh pers. comm. 2016)."

However, it is dependent upon Acroporacoral reefs as its only food source, and is therefore highly susceptible to habitat loss. It has reportedly undergone local extinctions in Okinawa, Japan due to habitat loss. Of the 167Acroporaspecies occurring in the Indo-Pacific, 51 (30%) are listed in a threatened category (Vulnerable or Endangered), and another 23 (13%) are Near Threatened. This species is also highly sought after for the aquarium trade in some parts of its range, but little is known on the impact from this threat.

Due to its direct dependency onAcroporareefs and the ongoing degradation of those corals due to bleaching throughout its range, we infer thatO. longirostriswill experience projected population declines of at least 30% over the next three generations.",decreasing,"Oxymonacanthus longirostris occurs in clear lagoon and seaward reefs. It nests near bases of dead corals, often on clumps of algae. It feeds exclusively on Acropora polyps. Feeding takes place throughout the day becoming less towards the evening (Barlow 1987). The maximum length recorded is 12 cm total length (TL) (Lieske and Myers 1994). Most individuals live no more than two years (K. Matsuura pers. comm. 2015). Therefore, we infer that ten years is greater than three generation lengths.It is a monogamous species (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001, Whiteman and Côté 2004). It lives in an exclusive and heterosexual pair, with the male and female sharing the same territory to feed. Aggression is used commonly in courtship. Spawning commences when after swimming together in different tufts, the female concentrates on just one and begins to thrust repeatedly and pause. The male follows suit nuzzling the female. The female then drops into the algae and spawns, while the male releases the sperm beside her. The pair then swims back to their territory (Barlow 1987). This species produces between 200 and 300 eggs per clutch (Barlow 1987).Coral bleaching can rapidly affect this corallivorous species. At one site of Okinawa Island (Japan), the growth rates of adults during the 1998 coral bleaching event were significantly lower than those measured in 1997. Tagged harlequin filefish were found to disappear at rates significantly higher than in previous years and no individuals (juvenile, young or adult) observed in March 1999 (Kokita and Nakazono 2001). As this species exhibits strong site fidelity and the abundance nearby did not noticeably increase, it was presumed that the individuals died in response to the bleaching event (Kokita and Nakazono 2001). Similarly, at Cousine Island (the Seychelles), this species declined rapidly after extensive coral mortality in 1998 from a mean of 6.4 individuals per count in 1997 to 0.0 individuals per count in 1999 (Spalding and Jarvis 2002). Kokita and Nakazono (2001) concluded that the occurrence of healthy acroporid corals, which appear to be particularly susceptible to coral bleaching is essential to the survival of this species in the wild.","Because of its dependency on Acropora reefs, O. longirostris is susceptible to population declines due to habitat loss in parts of its range. As of 2008, 15% of the world’s coral reefs were considered under imminent threat of being “Effectively Lost” (with 90% of the corals lost and unlikely to recover soon), with regions in East Africa, South and South-east Asia among the most threatened (Wilkinson and Souter 2008). Of 704 zooxanthellate reef-building coral species which were assessed by using the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Criteria, 32.8% are in categories with elevated risk of extinction (Carpenteret al.2008). Of the 167Acroporaspecies occurring in the Indo-Pacific, 51 (30%) are listed in a threatened category (Vulnerable or Endangered), and another 23 (13%) are Near Threatened. In 1998, an extensive bleaching event was observed in reef areas worldwide. This event severely impacted the fringing reefs of Bise, off the northwest coast of Okinawa, Japan, with most of the living coral dying and filamentous algae quickly covering the dead corals. Of all species, acroporid corals seemed the most susceptible to bleaching (Hoegh-Guldberg and Salvat 1995,McClanahan 2000).According to a leading expert in aquarium-related fishes,O. longirostrisis one of the most difficult ornamental fishes to keep alive in captivity (Michael 1999), yet data from the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, and theMarine Aquarium Database (GMAD) which was assembled in 2000, indicateO. longirostrisis one of, if not the, most heavily traded fishes that have been classified as most unsuitable for maintenance in aquaria (Wabnitzet al.2003). Reports in the database indicate that 1,393 individuals of Harlequin filefish were traded between the years of 1999-2002, but reports by exporters between the same time period indicate that nearly 16,000 individuals were exported. High collection rates of this fish for the aquarium trade in addition to the higher frequency of natural disaster events such as bleaching observed in recent years may genuinely put at risk local populations and drive stocks below their critical recovery level (Kokita and Nakazono 1999, Kokita and Nakazono 2001).",There are no known specific conservation measures in place for this species. There are a number of marine protected areas that overlap with its range.,"Oxymonacanthus longirostris is a very popular fish in the ornamental aquarium fish trade. It is mainly capturedand exported around the worldfrom the Philippines and Fiji. As of 2003, trade data from importers reflected that nearly 16,000 individuals are received, worldwide, on a yearly basis for sale in the aquarium trade (Wabnitz et al. 2003)."

Carpenter pers. comm. 2009).The phylogeny of sparids, and the taxonomy of snapper in particular, has attracted considerable attention. In Australasia, snapper had previously been assigned to the genus Chrysophrys, formerly as Chrysophrys unicolor and more latterly as C. auratus (Paulin 1990). Paulin (1990) determined Pagrus to be the senior synonym of Chrysophrys, and re-described C. auratus as Pagrus auratus. In addition, he concluded that the species known as red sea bream in Japan, i.e. Pagrus major, was a conspecific and should also be re-described as P. auratus. Researchers in Japan, however, have not adopted this taxonomy (Jackson 2007).","Pagrus auratus occurs from New Zealand and Australia to 300 m depth. This species is very important in commercial and recreational fisheries throughout most of its range. Pagrus auratushas undergone major declines in the past and should continue to be monitored carefully; however, this species is abundant in parts of its range and there are a number of management regulations in place. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.","Pagrus auratus is distributed in the Indo-West Pacificfrom New Zealand and Australia (Paulin 1990, Hayes 1994, Curley et al.2013). This species occurs to 300 m depth (Kailola et al.1993).","The commercial and recreational fisheries for Pagrus auratus in Australia comprise a national total catch of c. 3,000 tonnes per year including Queensland (c. 700 tonnes), New South Wales (c. 500 tonnes), Victoria (c. 500 tonnes), South Australia (c. 900 tonnes), and Western Australia (c. 600 tonnes)(Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry 2012). The total national catch for New Zealand is c. 14,000 tonnes per year (N.Z. Ministry for Primary Industries 2012). Australia In the West Coast Bioregion (WCB) of Australia there is a single genetic stock ofPagrus auratuswith genetic isolation by distance (Gardner 2011). In Shark Bay, there are three separate stocks within the two gulfs and they are distinct from the stock in adjacent oceanic waters (Johnsonet al.1986, Edmondset al. 1989, Moranet al.1998, Edmondsetal.1999, Bastowet al.2002, Moranet al. 2003).Shark Bay in Western Australia is one of the most important locations for fishing of this species, and this fishery began in the early 1900s moving to the inner gulfs by the 1920s (Cooper 1997, Edwards 2000) with effort increasing until the 1950s and subsequently declining steadily in the 1960s and 1970s (Bowen 1961, Marriott et al.2011). The catch ofP. auratusin South Australia has notably increased and this species has become the highest State-based contributor to the national commercial catch reaching 972 tonnes worth USD 6.5 million in 2010–2011 (Fowleret al.2012). Commercial catches of this species in the inner gulfs of Shark Bay contribute around less than two tonnes per year (Cooper 1997). However, the commercial oceanic fishery in this area previously produced the largest catch ofP. auratusin Australia reaching about 600 tonnes per year (Marriottet al.2011). Approximately 190 tonnes of this species was taken in the WCB, 263 tonnes in the Gasoyne Coast Bioregion (GCB) (Faircloughet al. 2012, Jacksonet al.2012b) and 40 tonnes in the South Coast Bioregion in 2010/2011 (Molony et al.2012).Recreational catches in this area were believed to be unsustainable by the mid 1990s and by 1995 the Denham Recreational Advisory Committee proposed a number of management regulations to limit recreational catches (Jackson and Moran 2012).The total estimated recreational boat-based catch in the WCB increased from 25 tonnes in 1996/1997 to 40 tonnes in 2005/2006 (Sumner et al.2008) and subsequently decreased to 24 tonnes in 2009/2010 following the introduction of a variety of management measures during 2007-2009 (Fairclough et al.2010). The total estimated recreational boat-based catch in the GCB was 30 tonnes in 2007/2008 and catch taken by charter vessels was 12 tonnes in 2010/2011 (Jacksonet al.2012b). Recruitment had reached very low levels in the late 1990s, indicating that the stock was seriously depleted (Jackson and Moran 2012). After the implementation of a moratorium and subsequent Total Allowable Catch (TAC), daily bag limits, and minimum landing size; most of the stock recovered to c. 40% of the unexploited biomass by 2011 but this recovery has been extremely slow and the reasons for this are unknown (Jackson and Moran 2012).In the WCB, the estimates of F for the entire stock (2008/09–2010/11) declined from the assessment period 2005/06–2007/08 but it was about 1.5 times the limit reference point of 0.18 year<sup>-1</sup>. In the combined northern management areas of Kallbarri and Mid-west of the WCB, F decreased and SPR (spawning per recruit) increased. Although F and SPR both improved between the two assessment periods, F was still extremely high and SPR very low. In the combined southern management areas of Metropolitan and South-west, F and SPR also improved and were much low and higher, respectively, than for the combined northern areas (Fairclough et al.2014). New Zealand This species is widely distributed in New Zealand waters but is most abundant in the Hauraki Gulf. In New Zealand, catches peaked in 1978 at 18,000 tonnes but had declined to 8,500 tonnes to 9,000 tonnes by the mid 1980s with some stocks showing signs of overexploitation (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). The spawning stock biomass (SSB) of this species in New Zealand has decreased significantly since the 1970s in the east Northland, Hauraki Gulf and Bay of Plenty. The SSBs from 2011 in all three areas were estimated to be below 20% with that in the Bay of Plenty estimated at below 10%. Model SSB trajectories for P. auratusfor all three stocks after 2007 are either decreasing or have plateaued. Modeled five year projections indicate that current catch rates will not permit stock recovery in the eastern Northland or theHauraki Gulfand will most likely decrease P. auratusabundance in the Bay of Plenty(N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).Recent data suggest that P. auratusis increasing in abundance and has expanded its range in eastern Tasmania since the 1800s (Last et al.2011).Populations of this species seem to be 'closed' over relatively small spatial scales and connectivity is relatively low (Curley et al.2013).",decreasing,"Pagrus auratus is a highly resident, demersal species that occupies a wide variety of habitats including rocky reefs, and sand and mud bottoms to 200 m depth, but most commonly occurs between 15 m to 60 m depth (Parsons et al. 2011,N.Z.Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). Adults of this species aggregate over rocky reefs while juveniles are abundant in estuaries, and also around shallow coastal rocky reefs and over sand substrates near reefs (Henry and Gillanders 1999, Ross et al.2007). This species prefers patchy habitats with high complexity such as horse mussel beds, Corallinaturf, sponges, sea squirts, pits and burrows (Kingett and Choat 1981, Morrison et al. 2008). This species is an important predator in shallow reef communities of northeastern New Zealand and has been shown to play a significant role in the re-establishment of community level trophic cascades after the implementation of marine reserves (Shears and Babcock 2002).Growth of P. auratusis relatively slow, with fish reaching about 11 to 14 cm (FL) after one year, 16 to 20 cm (FL) after two years, and 23 to 34 cm (FL) after four years (<span class='s1'>Longhurst 1958,<span class='s1'>Paul 1976,<span class='s1'>Horn 1986,<span class='s1'>McKenzieet al.1992,<span class='s1'>Walshet al.2006). Growth rates have been shown to differ between populations of P. auratuson the eastern and western coasts of the North Island of New Zealand, with fish from the western coast growing faster than fish from the eastern coast (<span class='s1'>Longhurst 1958). Pagrus auratushas been recorded to 54 years of age (Kalish 1993) but may live to 60 years or more (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). The maximum recorded length for this species is 130 cm (TL) (Randall et al.1990). Some individuals of this species exhibit high residency while other follow seasonal migrations (Parsons et al.2011). In Western Australia, inshore-offshore spawning migration takes place in the shelf waters off the west coast (Moran et al. 2003, Wakefield 2006, Wise et al.2007, Wakefield et al. 2011) and distances travelled increase with fish size (Wakefield et al.2011). Movement if very limited inside of Shark Bay (Moran and Kangas 2003, Norriss et al. 2012) and in Queensland (Moran and Kangas 2003, Sumpton et al. 2003) but up to 2,000 km in southern and eastern Australia (Sanders 1974, Fowler et al. 2005). <span class='s1'><span class='s1'> Reproduction  Pagrus auratusis a rudimentary hermaphrodite (functional gonochorist) (Francis and Pankhurst 1988, Buxton and Garratt 1990, Sadovy de Mitcheson and Liu 2008) and attains maturity between 20 and 28 cm (FL), at about three to four years of age (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).Pagrus auratusadultsoften aggregate outside harbours, bays and estuaries to spawn (<span class='s1'>Crossland 1977,<span class='s1'>Scott et al. 1993,<span class='s1'>Jackson 2007) usually from November to December. The spawning season may take place from January to March in some areas (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). Winter spawning grounds are thought to be in deeper waters (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). Spawning aggregations of P. auratus are known to occur outside the Kaipara and Manukau Harbours on the western coast of the North Island of New Zealand (<span class='s1'>Smith et al. 1978), and throughout much of the Hauraki Gulf on the eastern coast of the North Island (<span class='s1'>Zeldis and Francis 1998). In Western Australia, in Cockburn Sound, spawning takes place at night during the three hours after high tide and peaks around the new and full moons (Wakefield 2010). In Shark Bay, spawning occurs from early afternoon to late evening (Jackson and Cheng 2001). Larvae hatch at a relatively small size from 2.1 mm (SL) (<span class='s1'>Pankhurst et al. 1991), and spend 18 to 32 days in the plankton (<span class='s1'>Francis 1994,<span class='s1'>Fowler and Jennings 2003), before settling into the shallow waters of estuaries and bays at lengths of nine to 14 mm SL (<span class='s1'>Miskiewicz 1986,<span class='s1'>Trnski 2002,<span class='s1'>Hamer and Jenkins 2004). Pagrus auratusis a serial spawner that releases many batches of eggs throughout spring and summer. The young of this species will form schools in shallow, sheltered waters and move to deeper water in the winter, dispersing more widely with age (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). Water temperature plays a major role in the success of recruitment, and strong year classes in the population generally correspond to warm years and weak classes to cold years (Francis 1993). Fecundity of an average sized female (45 cm (FL)) is estimated at <span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'><span class='s1'>c. 3.5 million eggs (Ferrell and Sumpton 1997).","Pagrus auratusforms spawning aggregations and is subject to targeted fishing pressure in Australia and New Zealand at aggregation sites (Wakefield 2010, Jackson et al.2012, N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012). This species has been subject to overexploitation in many parts of its range, although there is some evidence of recovery in some areas (Jacksonet al.2012, N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).","The Denham Recreational Advisory Committee proposed a number of management regulations in 1995 to limit recreational catches, including an overall possession limit and a species specific daily bag limit during the spawning season ofP. auratus(Jackson and Moran 2012).In March 1996, the State Recreational Fishing Advisory Committee also recommended a range of management measures to protect P. auratus;these regulations includedan increase in minimum size from 41 cm to 45 cm (TL), the introduction of a maximum size limit of only two fish greater than 70 cm (TL) per day per person, and a daily bag limit of four fish per person. However, these measures were not popular with large numbers of recreational fishers and were not supported by the Minister of the day, who requested further research to more adequately establish the status of P. auratus stocks (Marshall and Moore 2000).A moratorium on fishing ofP. auratusin the Eastern Gulf of Shark Bay was implemented in May 1997 but wasoverturned in July 1997 due to public opposition (Marshall and Moore 2000). Although the Eastern Gulf fishery for this species was reopened, additional restrictions were implemented, including a slot limit of 50 cm to 70 cm (TL), a daily bag limit of two fish, and the main spawning ground being closed to all fishing.After the daily egg production method (DEPM) (Zeldis 1993) successfully assessed the stocks of P. auratusin Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand in 1992 (Zeldis and Francis 1998), and in northern Spencer Gulf, South Australia in 1994–1995 (McGlennon 2003), DEPM surveys were undertaken in Shark Bay from May to September 1997. The results of the surveys from the Eastern Gulf warranted the closing of the fishery in June 1998 and this fishery remained under moratorium until March 2003. By 2001, most of the stock had recovered to c. 40% of its unexploited biomass, but the Freycinet Estuary stock remained below 30% of the unexploited biomass, making an unexpectedly slow recovery. It was recommended that the daily bag limit for P. auratus in the Eastern Gulf and Denham Sound could be increased to two fish to permit recreational fishers to catch more while remaining within the overall TACs (Jackson and Moran 2012). The Quota Management System (QMS) was introducedin 1986 and Total Allowable Commercial Catches (TACCs) for all stocks ofP. auratusin New Zealand were established to allow for some stock recovery (N.Z. Ministry of Primary Industries 2012).Currently, in Shark Bay, recreational fishing regulations include a daily bag limit of two fish per person per day, a minimum landing size of 50 cm and a maximum size of 70 cm, a closed fishing season from 1 May to 31 July in the Eastern Gulf and 15 August to 30 September in theFreycinet Estuary (Department of Fisheries 2013).","Pagrus auratus is a very important commercial and recreational species in New Zealand. In New Zealand this species is the basis of one of the largest and most valuable coastal fisheries in the country. The commercial fishery in New Zealand developed in the last century and expanded in the 1970s with increased catches by trawl and Danish seine. Pair trawling accounted for 75% on average of the annual catch of P. auratus in northwest New Zealand from 1976 to 1989. In northern New Zealand, an increasing amount of the catches were taken by long-line with the development of the Japanese 'iki jime' market. Pagrus auratusis also caught as bycatch in some fisheries (N.Z. Ministry for Primary Industries 2012). This species is also one of the most valuable commercial and recreational species in eastern Australia (Hughes et al.2008).In Western Australia, this species is also a major component of the recreational and commercial fisheries. It is a highly sought after recreational species and is targeted primarily by boat-based fishers in the West Coast and Gascoyne Coast bioregions, especiallyShark Bay (Telfer 2010, Fairclough et al.2012, Wise et al. 2012). Pagrus auratushas a very long history of exploitation in Western Australia, especially in Shark Bay (Marrriott et al.2012). This species is one of the key demersal target species in the West Coast Demersal Scalefish (Interim) Managed Fishery (Fairclough et al. 2012), the Gascoyne Demersal Scalefish Managed Fishery (Jackson et al.2012b) and is also taken in the temperate Demrsal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery (Fairclough et al. 2012)."

Yan Ma pers. comm. 2016).,"This widely distributed, coral reef species is heavily targeted throughout its range, particularly for the live reef food fish trade centred in Hong Kong and other parts of China. Due to overfishing, its population has experienced global-level declines of between 30-50% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). These declines arereflected in a documented 93% decline in imports to Hong Kong markets over at least the past 18 years despite its continued high market value. Loss and/or major reductions of spawning aggregations has also occurred in parts of its range. Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable A2bd.Future assessments of this species should account for the possibility that separate species may be recognized from the Red Sea versus the remainder of its currently recognized range. A key recommendation is to focus conservation and monitoring actions on spawning aggregations and reduce fishing effort.","This Indo-Pacific species has a somewhat patchy distribution in the Indian Ocean where it is known from the Comoros, Red Sea, the Maldives, Chagos,<span style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);'>the Laccadive Islands and Gulf of Mannar,the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Myanmar and Thailand(Nair 2015, R. Myers pers. comm. 2016). In the Pacific, it occurs from the Philippines north to the Ryukyu Islands (Japan) and south to Indonesia, Australia (northern Western Australia and Queensland), Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and most of Micronesia. Its depth range is 1-70 metres (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2017).","This is possibly the most abundantPlectropomusspecies in the central Western Pacific. However, there have been severe declines in certain areas, due in part to targeting of spawning aggregations by local and foreign commercial fishers driven by its high value in the international live reef food fish trade centred in Hong Kong (Sadovy and Vincent 2002, Sadovy de Mitchesonet al. 2013). In Pacific countries, it is the most abundant and main target grouper species for the Live Reef Food Fish Trade. Although spawning can be induced in this species, it is not commercially raised in hatcheries (Tucker and Fitzgerald 1994, Y. Sadovy pers. obs.); however, juveniles are harvested from the wild for grow-out in aquaculture, which exacerbates population decline (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009).There appears to be intensification of fishing effort throughout the area where this species is fished for sale in the live reef fish food trade. The Squaretail Coralgrouper is a medium-valued low-volume fish with annual reported imports into Hong Kong in the hundreds of tonnes only. Sources are mainly Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia, all caught in the wild. Often it is harvested from spawning aggregations and is very easy to overfish if the aggregations are targeted. The Squaretail Coralgrouper is also referred to in AFCD (Hong Kong Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department) and C&amp;SD (Census and Statistics international trade data of the Hong Kong government) databases as Spotted Coralgrouper/Trout and AFCD confirmed that these common names refer to P. areolatus in both databases. Fish enter Hong Kong both by air and vessel (Hong Kong live fish vessels or HKLFV). This species makes up just a small proportion of the HK-based live reef fish trade with an increasing proportion being imported by sea compared to air (Sadovy de Mitcheson et al.2017). Landings in the Philippines declined precipitously between 2015-2016 (Santos et al. 2017). According to declining trends in trade data, large-scale population declines are likely to have occurred as a result (Y. Sadovy and K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). The amount imported to Hong Kong in 1997 was 2,319 tonnes (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999), which subsequently declined to 69 tonnes in 2006 before increasing to an average of around 150 tonnes from 2007 to 2014, an anomalous increase in imports to 458 tonnes was recorded in 2015 (possibly due to the Philippines, see Santos et al. 2017), but returned in 2016 to about 160 tonnes, which represents an overall decline of 93% over the past 18 years (Y. Sadovy unpublished data 2016, Sadovy de Mitcheson et al. 2017). In the last two years,P. areolatushas not been as common in the market in mainland China; therefore, the decline observed in Hong Kong's statistics is implied to also be occurring in mainland China as well (M. Liu pers. comm. 2016).We suspect that the imports into Hong Kong are representative of a large portion of the range of this population, but there are portions of its range beyond the normal live reef fish food trade influence. For example, fish traders in Hong Kong do not import from the Indian Ocean west of the Maldives (K. Ma pers. comm. 2016). Therefore, we suspect that the actual global-level declines over the past three generation lengths (21 years) is between 30-50%. In addition, many spawningaggregations are declining somewhere in the order of60 to 100% (Hamilton et al. 2004, Rhodes et al. 2015, Hamilton et al. 2016, J. Pet pers. comm. 2016, Conservation Society of Pohnpeiand A. Hughes unpub. data). <strong style=''>Maldives: In the Maldives, Plectropomus areolatus abundance is lower in the more heavily fished outer reef channels than in less intensely fished channels on the western side of Laamu Atoll (Sluka 2002). In 2011, an annual maximum sustainable yield of 87.41 metric tons was suggested for the entire Maldives (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). The Maldives was once a major importer of live Squaretail Coralgrouper. Between 1994 and 1996, over 500 mt of live groupers (all species combined) were exported annually. By 2007, exports were less than 100 mt. Between 2004 and 2010, exports of chilled groupers increased five-fold from around 150 mt to 550 mt, representing around 450,000 fish (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In addition, mean lengths of squaretail coralgrouper declined from over 50 cm to less than 40 cm between the 1987-1991 and 2010-2011 periods.<strong style=''>Kiribati and other Pacific locales: The species is apparently the most abundant live reef food fish species in the Fijian Islands (Yeeting et al. 2001). Aggregation sites, such as Mali Passage, are no longer considered productive after protracted fishing at that site. Much of the current fishery appears to be illegal, unregulated and unmonitored and the fishery is heavily reliant on both nighttime and SCUBA spearfishing, which are known to be unsustainable fishing methods. Catch-per-unit-effort reportedly substantiallydeclined in just 10 years. In 2015, the estimated take of groupers was in excess of 20 mt, which is considered unsustainable and greater than the volumes taken from Bua in the past when the live reef food fish trade was targeting aggregations for export(Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015). In Abaiang Atoll of the Gilberts Group (Kiribati), targeting of spawning aggregations had been practised in historical tradition, but pressure increased to an intense level in the 1980s during the implementation of the Outer Island Fisheries Project. The Project buys fish from the outer islands to sell in the capital city of Tarawa. During peak fishing season, daily catch of P. areolatus was about two tonnes (about 1,200 individuals). An underwater visual survey conducted during this same time period showed a mean density of 0.13 individuals per 100 m², with a mean individual total length of 40 cm (Yeeting unpub. data 1999). A subsequent survey in 2004 showed that mean density had declined to 0.04 individuals per 100 m², and mean total length declined to 33 cm (ProcFish 2005). Other densities (per 100 m²) and mean total length (cm) estimates are as follows: 0.19 and 37 in Abemama, Kiribati; 0.0057 and 50 in Chuuk, FSM; 0.0072 and 38 in Salelavalu, Samoa; 0.074 and 44 in Funafuti, Tuvalu; 0.081 and 37 in Nukufetau, Tuvalu (ProcFish 2005). Palau: Plectropomus areolatus, along withEpinephelus fuscoguttatusandEpinephelus polyphekedion, dominate the commercial catch of groupers in Palau (Kitalong and Dalzell 1994). At least four Palau grouper spawning aggregations have disappeared since the 1970s, including one composed primarily ofP. areolatus. Sites include Rebotel, Mesikm near German Channel and Uchul a Chei on the southern tip of Ngermediu reef (lost in the 1970s) (N. Idechong pers. comm. 2016). An aggregation site ofP. areolatusandE. fuscoguttatuswas virtually eliminated at Denges in the late 1980s by a live grouper export fishing enterprise (Johannes et al. 1999). Possibly as a result of fishing pressure, the P. areolatus aggregation at Ebiil has been reduced in size to only one of two sides of the channel (Johannes et al. 1999).Evidence collected in 2008-2009 from enhanced underwater visual census confirmed that aggregations ofP. areolatusare confined to one side of the channel. Estimates of abundance showed aggregations with highest abundances in May-July of around 450 individuals and between 200 to 300 individuals in April and September (PCS and SCRFA 2010). Market surveys conducted in August 2010 showed substantial numbers ofP. areolatusstill entering the fishery prior to the sales and catch and closure, with increasing numbers marketedas the August spawning period commenced. During this period, 776 individuals were marketed (PCS and SCRFA 2010), with a mean size of 17 cm (presumably total length). Many of these individuals are assumed to be female and/or below the size at sexual maturity (Rhodes et al. 2013). In 1996, very limited recruitment was observed in Ebiil and Western Entrance spawning aggregations, and negligible recruitment occurred at Ngerumekaol, suggesting that the larval settlement ofP. areolatustwo to three years earlier may have been very low. About five to 10 times as many females as males were counted in the most lightly fished area (Western Entrance), compared to heavily fished areas (Johannes et al. 1999). This sex ratio may be responsible for the aggressive behaviour observed between sexes and may have prevented spawning. Micronesia: The density of fishinspawning aggregations declined by 60% from 2005 to 2013 in Pohnpei (Rhodes et al. 2014), but has stabilized since its initial decline in 2005, albeit at only one-third of its 2005 density.In 2006, a Pohnpeisurvey showed thatP. areolatuscomprised &gt;12% of groupers targeted by the spear and line fishery and was the sixth most abundant grouper in marketed catches, with the majority of the catch composed of juveniles: 75.6% and 97.2% of marketed catch of females and males, respectively, below the mean size at sexual maturity(Rhodes and Tupper 2007). By 2015, the species ascended to the second most abundant grouper observed in marketed catch, representing 19% of the grouper fishery (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). Eighty-one percent of marketedP. areolatuswere above the 50% size at sexual maturity for females. Consistent declines in aggregation abundance have been documented within the Kehpara Marine Sanctuary, with a 69% decline in density observed between 2001 and 2013 and the notable disappearance of individuals along the shallow-water transect over this time-frame (Rhodes et al. 2014). In 2013, average densities in the aggregation were eight individuals per 100 m². Local commercial fishers are also responsible for targeting spawning aggregations and reproductive migratory pathways, resulting in reduced abundances following heavy fishing (Rhodes and Tupper 2008, Johannes et al. 1999, Hamilton and Kama 2004). Protracted fishing in the absence of effective enforcement has resulted in a 69% decline in mean density at one aggregation site in Pohnpei, with notablechanges in depth distribution (Rhodes et al. 2014). Obvious changes in percent contribution to marketed catch and size distribution were observed during a 10-year follow-up market survey in 2015, with an increase in contribution from 12% to 19% over 10 years (D. Hernandez-Ortiz and K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).In Chuuk, Micronesia, the absence of gravid females in market samples suggests that spawning aggregations are not a major target for this fishery (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016). A 12-month Chuukmarket study,P. areolatuswas the third in abundance among all species sampled from the catch, and contributed 15.4% to the total mixed-gear fishery, with 49% of captured individuals immature(J. Cuetos-Bueno and D. Hernandez-Ortiz unpublished data 2016).During recent underwater visual surveys, the species was recorded at only two of four Pacific Island countries: Pohnpei and Yap, and was not recorded in Guam and Kosrae. Densities in Pohnpei were 1.6 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>, 0.6 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>on Ifalik Atoll, and 0.43 individuals/ha<sup>-1</sup>at Satawal Atoll(B. Taylor unpub. data 2016).<strong style=''>Indonesia: Spawning aggregations of this species across Indonesia appear to be largely decimated, based on low densities of fish in inshore waters (J. Pet pers. comm. 2016).Despite protection of spawning aggregation sites as of 2001 in Indonesia's Komodo National Park, heavy fishing pressure continued. A five-year monitoring program conducted from 1995-2000 at two spawning aggregation sites within the park, recorded that the mean length of individuals decreased by 8 cm and fish numbers at aggregations were low, at less than 100 per aggregation site and period (Pet et al. 2005). Enforcement and monitoring lapses in this park resulted in the apparent extirpationof at least one aggregation site and significant declines in others (Mangubhaiet al. 2011).At Ayau, Raja Ampat, approximately 300 individuals were observed in a spawning aggregation that formed in areas of high coral cover on the southeast corner of the island (Wilson et al. 2010).After the implementation of stricter rules governing marine protected areas in Aceh, individuals of this species increased in length from 16 to 35 cm by 2009, and some observed were greater than 40 cm in 2010 (Yulianto et al. 2015). Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea: Hamilton and Smith (2005) reported that two to three Manus fishers (Papua New Guinea) can remove an estimated 100 individuals per night from spawning sites using night-time spearfishing techniques; as a result of this heavy pressure, abundance and catch declines have occurred (Hamilton 2003). Marovo (Solomon Islands) fishermen state that the average aggregationsize ofP. areolatushas been declining since spearfishing became widely practised in the area. Increasing human population in the Western Solomon Islands (doubling about every 17 years) is also exerting pressure on the species.In Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, 24-hour daily fishing operations between 1996 and 1997 removed an estimated three to four tonnes of grouper species per trip, includingP. areolatus(Hamilton and Kama 2004). Catch per unit effort (CPUE) records from Roviana Lagoon estimate a catch rate of 16.8 kg/hr per fisher during the course of 41 fishing trips (Hamilton et al. 2005). At least one RovianaP. areolatus aggregation has been fished to economic extinction (Hamilton et al. 2005). In addition, destructive fishing practices associated with this fishery significantly damaged coral reef habitat within the aggregation site (K. Rhodes pers. obs.). In Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, the live reef food fish trade has operated sporadically during the past decade and spawning aggregations and reproductive migratory pathways are systematically targeted; as a result,declines in abundance have frequently been severe. Community-based monitoring and enforcement has resulted in improvements in aggregation abundance and density inside protected areas at Djual, New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea, with a 37-fold difference in mean densities being detected between areas inside protected areas (7.34 individuals/1,000 m²) versus outside (0.2 individuals/1,000 m²) (Hamilton et al. 2011, Hamilton et al. 2016). Australia: The only known statistics on theP. areolatusfishery come from the Torres Strait where it is lumped with other live reef fish. Live fish exports in 2011-2012 were 930 tonnes (AUDUSD 31,953), 832 tonnes (USD 30,664) in 2012-2013 and 910 tonnes (USD 34,174) in 2013-2014 (Savage and Hobsbawn 2015). British Indian Ocean Territory: This species was not observed between 2010 and 2015 across several underwater visual survey sites that included Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Djibouti and Comoros, but was observed at Chagos in six of the 13 sampling sites, with an average abundance of 0.23 ±0.21 individuals per 250 m² and a mean biomass of 423.79 ±476.68 grams per 250 m² (M. Samoilys unpublished data 2016). Saudi Arabia: In theSaudi Arabian portion of the Red Sea, FAO fishery catch statistics recorded that an average of 400 metric tons of this species were landed from 2000-2014.<strong style=''>Sudan: This species was present at eight out of 40 surveysites along the coastofSudan in 2007 (Cousteau 2008, M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016).",decreasing,"This species inhabits lagoon and seaward reefs in areas with rich coral growth. It is most frequently encountered in channels along the reef front. Its maximum length is 73 cm. It feeds exclusively on fishes. The species commonly co-aggregates with the camouflage grouper (Epinephelus polyphekadion)and brown-marbled grouper (E. fuscoguttatus). The sexual pattern of the species is unresolved; however, males have been found to be older and larger than females at first observed maturity, which suggests the potential for protogynous hermaphroditism (Rhodes et al. 2014). Egg and larval dispersal are highly localized (Almany et al. 2013). In Palau, mature females ranged between 34.7 and 51 cm fork length, and males between 39 and 55.7 cm, but size distribution varied significantly between aggregations. In Pohnpei, the mean standard length for mature females was 39 cm, with males averaging 46.2 cm (Rhodes and Tupper 2008). Age at first maturity is two years and longevity is 13 years (Rhodes et al. 2011). Males and females differ significantly in size, with males larger and older than females. The total instantaneous mortality in Pohnpei has been estimated at Z = 0.428 (Rhodes et al. 2013). Applyingan age at first maturity of 2 years and longevity of 12 years, the generation length is estimated as 7 years based on the following equation: Age at first reproduction + (Age at last reproduction – age at first reproduction)/2.In Chuuk, Micronesia, the oldest individual was aged at 11 years old and 59.4 cm total length and the length at 50% maturity was 31-32 cm (K. Rhodes unpublished data 2016).The species forms spawning aggregations during specific lunar phases depending on locale.Males tend to arrive to aggregation sites individually or in small groupsone to four days earlier than females to establish territories. Females arrive in large schools and appear to spend several hours integrating with males in the aggregation (K. Rhodes pers. obs). Individuals of both sexes appear to use reproductive migratory corridors to reach aggregation sites, which increase their vulnerability to fisheries (Rhodes and Tupper 2008). In the Solomon Islands (and likely elsewhere),P. areolatusmoves to shallow reef habitats (e.g., reef flat) at night during spawning periods. These areas are easily accessible to fishers, who then obtain exceptionally high catches over short periods of time (Johannes 1988, Hamilton 2007). An acoustic telemetry study revealed that individuals are capable of moving to and from spawning sites over a minimum of 23 km and maintain home range areas of 0.004 to 0.12 km while residing in areas of high coral cover (Hutchinson and Rhodes 2010). Distances averaging 0.34 kmfrom the home range are travelled for feeding, and an average movement of five to 10 km are travelled for spawning and up to about 23 km are traveled along reproductive migratory corridors (Rhodes and Tupper 2008). As demonstrated by Pohnpeifisheries data collected in January 2005 over a five-day period leading up to the 'normal' full moon spawning time, some aggregations that appear within the presumed reproductive season, including some of substantial size, may not be reproductive and composed entirely, or nearly so, of a single sex (K. Rhodes and Tupper unpublished data). If confirmed, fishing on large, same-sex aggregations could impact sex ratios during subsequent reproductive periods in a manner similar to that shown for other aggregating groupers (Koenig et al. 1996). Aggregation-associated abundances can number in the thousands of individuals (Conservation Society of Pohnpei unpub. data). However, there aremany areas with aggregations that may be naturally small that are composed of tens to hundreds of individuals (Hamilton pers. comm. 2016).<strong style=''>Known spawning aggregation sites: One of the earliest records of spawning aggregations ofP. areolatuswas in the Solomon Islands (Johannes 1988). Johannes (1988) noted aggregations in two outer reef passages and counted no more than 100 fish at any one time. A total of 5,781 individuals were recorded at the Pohnpei Kehpara Marine Sanctuary in Palikir Pass, Ant Channel spawning site during peak aggregation periods in 2001 (J. Pet pers. comm.2016). Aggregations have been recorded as deep as 70 metres in Pohnpei (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). Spawning aggregations are known from the Solomon Islands in front of Uepi Island, at Nusa Agana, Shark Point and Njari (Western Province). A total of eight potential and known aggregation sites ofP. areolatusoccur in Palau (Sadovy 2007).In Palau, it aggregates in Ebiil, Western Entrance and Ngerumekaol. Other aggregations are located in the Chagos Archipelago, the Mundoo Channel in the Maldives, Kiribati and the Abaiang atoll, in Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Samoa. Occasional individuals are sighted in Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea (Allen 1998). In Indonesia's Komodo National Park, the species formed spawning aggregations during full moon periods from September to February and occasionally during new moon periods (Pet et al. 2005). At Roviana Lagoon in the Solomon Islands, Hamilton and Kama (2004) identified seven spawning sites forP. areolatusthrough fisher interviews, with a reported peak in spawning activity between October and January during third quarter to new moon lunar phases. Spawning aggregations have been recorded from the Lakshadweep Islands (Karkarey et al. 2011).","The major threat to this speciesis commercial fishing for the commercial live reef food-fish trade, particularly heavy fishing effort targeting spawning aggregations (Sadovy et al. 2003). Reductions in population densities and changes in habitat use have also been noted as a result of climatic disturbance, which suggests the potential for future negative impacts from climate change (Williams et al. 2014). Hamilton (unpub. data) reports that night-time spear fishing in the Solomon Islands is a threat to spawning aggregations due to exceptionally high catch rates. Fishing pressure from subsistence fishing is not usually considered a major threat.","This speciesoccurs in several protected areas throughout its range, including some specifically designed to protect spawning aggregations (Rhodes et al. 2005). Seasonal closures associated with spawning times are also in place in some areas (Rhodes and Sadovy 2002), but enforcementis not effective (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). Size-limits and catch quotas have also been imposed in various sites in Australia. In Queensland (Australia), the catch size limits applied across all sectors of the coral reef fin fish fishery that includes commercial and recreational fishers, and charter boat operators are a minimum 38 cm total length and a total combined bag of seven individuals. The minimum size limit is designed to ensure that at least half of the fish in a population reach reproductive maturity and spawn before harvest.InPalau, the Marine Protection Act of 1994 prohibits sale or purchase ofP. areolatus(andE. polyphekadionorE. fuscoguttatus) from April 1 through July 31 each year, with the intention to protect spawning aggregations. In 1995, the Act was amended to prohibit any capture of these groupers even for subsistence purpose in the closed period (Johannes et al. 1999). A four-month bul (taboo) was enforced in the state of Ngeremlengui (Palau), but was not completely effective in preventing fishing on aggregations. Recently, the national ban was extended from 1 April to 31 October and there is a three-year ban commencing July 2015 in Ngarchelong and Kayangel State until July 2018. Export is allowed during the open season, but there is a 50 lb. limit per person for reef fish (S. Victor pers. comm. 2016). In Pohnpei (Micronesia), asales ban is enforced during the January-May spawning season on all groupers, which includesP. areolatus(Rhodes and Tupper 2007). Three Pohnpeimarine protected areas are in place to protect spawning aggregations for this species, but abundance declines have occurred over more than a decade for one of the three sites. No information is available for the other two sites due to the lack of monitoring (Rhodeset al. 2005). In Chuuk (Micronesia), alaw implemented in 2015 bans grouper sales, catch and export from January to May, which is during the spawning season ofP. areolatusand other known aggregating groupers (C. Graham pers. comm. 2015). In Karimunjawa National Park (Indonesia), fishers imposed a self-regulatory ban on catch ofP. areolatusin 2010. As of 2011, noP. areolatuswere found in catch and sizes had increased from &lt;15 cm in 2005 to &gt;40 cm in 2010 (Yuliantoet al. 2015). Community-based enforcement and monitoring of a marine protected area in Djual and New Ireland, Papua New Guinea resulted in the recovery of densities in aggregations (Hamiltonet al.2011, Hamiltonet al. 2016). In Kavieng, Papua New Guinea, trap fishing is now banned.Aggregation fishing should be managed or banned in the Solomon Islands, where aggregations occur in multiple and often closely spaced localities, because heavy fishing pressure is likely to rapidly deplete them (Johannes and Kile 2001). Sex and size structure in spawning aggregation should be monitored where fishing on spawning aggregations occurs.","This species is heavily exploited by local and foreign commercial fishers, especially when forming spawning aggregations. Most fish are sold for a high value to the international live reef food fish trade centred in Hong Kong (Sadovy and Vincent 2002, Sadovy et al. 2003, Sadovy de Mitchesonet al. 2013). It is taken for both live and fresh/dead for international and national trade using a combination of line, trap and possibly chemicals (sodium cyanide) and common consuming size is 38–50 cm total length (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999). The Maldives was also once a major importer of live Squaretail Coralgrouper (Darwin Reef Fish Project 2011). In Pohnpei, marketed fish were derived primarily from inner reef locales using spear (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). In Fiji,groupers in northern Vanua Levu outer reef passages are intensively fished during the spawning season of several important grouper species. The fishery includes both local and international markets and current exports are primarily for chilled fish. As a result of the international trade and overfishing in general, local markets are having increasing problems acquiring enough fish for local consumption (Sadovy de Mitcheson and Ramoica 2015). It is known to be fished in at least the following localities:the Maldives, Fijian Islands, the Gilberts Group (Kiribati), Samoa, Micronesia, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia andSaudi Arabia (Red Sea)."

It is heavily fished in parts of its range, and declines are likely to have occurred in the Solomon Islands, the Maldives and Indonesia. However, this species is fast-growing, and fishing is not considered to be a major threat on a global level at this time. It is listed as Least Concern with a recommendation to improve monitoring of fished populations, especially in areas where pressure is expected to increase in the future, and to protect spawning aggregations.The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data. ","This species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific from East Africa (Kenya to Mozambique) to the central and southern Pacific from southern Japan to the Great Barrier Reef and Middleton Reef off Australia in and in the western Pacific to the Tuamotus and Pitcairn Island. It has also been recorded from the eastern coast of India (Visakhapatnam) as Plectropomus leopardus (Sujatha and Shrikanya 2012). Its depth range is four to 100 metres.

It is also rare in the western Indian Ocean.It is exploited in much of its rangeand is an important part of the live reef food fish trade (LRFFT), but no historical species-specific fishery data are available. Landings data are typically aggregated under 'coral trout' or 'leopard grouper'. Its volumes in the LRFFT are not documented to species level, but a recent survey of the retail market in Hong Kong recorded that this species comprised 0.2 % of grouper individuals (S. Lam pers. comm. 2016).  Indian Ocean, Maldives and the Seychelles: The highest densities recorded for this species are from the protected Lihou Reef system in the Coral Sea (3.1) and the Chagos Archipelago (1.4) (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016). NoP. laeviswere observed during comprehensive surveys of Cocos/Keeling and Christmas Island in 2004 (H. Choat unpublished data). Despite extensive surveys in the Seychelles,P. laeviswas only recorded on granitic reefs of the Mahe Plateau at very low densities. It was also the rarest species in a demographic study of Aldabra serranids (Grandcourt 2005, Pears 2005). A survey of grouper fauna in the Maldives concluded thatP. laeviswas rare (Sluka 2002), with abundance patterns similar to that obtained from the Seychelles. This species is one of the eight most important grouper species in the Maldives grouper fishery as taken for the live reef fish export trade (Sattar and Adam 2005). The fishery was initiated in 1994, and one million groupers were landed in 1997. By 2005, landings had declined by 75%, mean size of captured individuals also declined and 43% of the grouper catch was comprised of immature individuals.  Indonesia: In northern Indonesia, this was one of the rarer grouper species according to catch per unit effort data and annual landings for this species declined from 1995 to 2003(Scaleset al.2007). Density per hectare was from one to five individuals during underwater surveys conducted in 2004-2011 (S. Suharti pers. comm. 2016).  Australia: Surveys on West Australian offshore reefs observed thatP. laeviswas never abundant compared toP. leopardusandP. areolatus(Done et al. 1994). Surveys at Ashmore Reef (Indian Ocean) revealed very low numbers: 0.1 (1998) and 0.03 (2005) individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> (Kospartovet al.2005). This low abundance may be due to heavy fishing by Indonesian fishers. On the northeastern coast of Australia this species was rarely observed (0-0.1 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>), but in the Coral Sea, it was more common at 0.5-0.8 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>(Ayling and Ayling 1986). On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), even on reefs with the highest level of protection (no entry), this species is rare compared to other members of the genus. Underwater surveys conducted on the GBR recorded abundances of ~0.3 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>in 1994 and 0.1-0.3 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>in 2001 (Ayling and Choat unpublished data). In no-entry preservation zones, the numbers were also 0.3 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>. Higher numbers (0.5-0.9 per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>) were recorded in the remote northern GBR and Coral Sea reefs and atolls. Relatively low numbers of Plectropomus laevis were recorded from offshore west Australian reefs both at fished sites (Ashmore Reef; Kospartov et al. 2006) and unfished sites (Rowley Shoals, Scott Reef; Done et al. 1994). More recent surveys conducted on 82 northern GBR reefs recorded 0.2-0.32 individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>in protected outer reefs and 0.15 in outer reefs open to fishing; 0.02-0.07 in protected mid-shelf reefs and 0 in mid-shelf reefs open to fishing (B. Taylor pers. comm. 2016). Fished populations on the Great Barrier Reef have an age structure skewed strongly toward young (3 to 4 year old) fish (Davieset al.2006). Increasing access to remote areas by charter boat line and spearfishers could cause future declines.  Western Pacific islands: In Pohnpei (Micronesia), P. laevis comprised only 0.1% of the serranid line and spearcatch in 2006 (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). Estimates of abundance (individuals per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup>) from outer reefs in three Pacific localities found the following: Fiji (0.54 individuals), New Caledonia (1.2 individuals) and Tonga (0.43 individuals). These numbers are consistent with estimates from other localities surveyed (IRD database Accessed 2008). According to fisher interviews conducted in the Solomon Islands, catch has declined on an aggregation (Hamilton 2003).",unknown,"This species inhabits outer coral reef slopes between four to 100 metres depth (Heemstra and Randall 1993, Kailola et al. 1993). It feeds mostly on fishes and occasionally crustaceans (Leiske and Myers 1994). It forages over greater areas and depth range than the co-occurringPlectropomus leopardus(Matley et al. 2016). It isa monandric protogynous hermaphrodite (males derived exclusively through sexual transition of mature females; Adams 2002, 2003). It is also a relatively fast-growing species that reaches 50 cm in less than four years with females reaching sexual maturity in under three years (Davies et al. 2006, Heupel et al. 2010). Similar growth rates are recorded from individuals taken from the Western Indian Ocean (Grandcourt 2005). It forms small spawning aggregations (M. Samoilys and H. Choat pers. comm. 2016), but large aggregations were reported from the northern GBR in the 1980's (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 2016). An aggregation of 30 largeP. laeviswas observed at Moore Reef GBR in 2014 (E. Fisher pers. comm. 2016). It is thought thatP. laevisspawns over deeper areas on reef fronts as compared toP. leopardus,which may explain the paucity of spawning observations forP. laevis. Small groups of reproductively activeP. laevishave been observed in French Polynesia (Tuamotus), Fiji (Y. Sadovy pers. comm. 2016) and Papua New Guinea (Hamilton 2003). On the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), it has been aged to at least 18 years, an age at maturity of 2.2 years at ~40 cm fork length, the youngest male was nine years of age with transitional individuals occurring at 8-9 years, natural mortality of 0.39 and maximum length of 115 cm (Davies et al. 2006, Heupel et al. 2010). In Aldabra, it has been aged to 20 years (Grandcourt 2005).<span style=''>Based on a longevity of 18 to 20 years, age of first maturity of 2 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to range from 10 to 11 years.","This species experiences overfishing in some localised areas, but this is not known to be a major threat on a global level. Given the increasing interest in juveniles of this species for the live food trade, there is potential for increased exploitation in the future.","In the Maldivian grouper fishery there is an annual quota of 30,000 individuals forthis species. In Pohnpei (Micronesia), this species is prohibited for sale, along with other groupers, during March and April (Rhodes and Tupper 2007). This species occurs in some protected areas in parts of its range. The current management plan for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Parkincludes size limits, total area closures to fishing (approximately 30% of the park is now comprised of areas closed to fishing)and temporal sales bans. However, the primary habitat of this species in eastern Australia (exposed reef fronts on the northern Great Barrier Reef and Coral Sea reef systems) have large areas of reef open to fishing. Increasing ease of access means that protection by isolation will be reduced in the near future.","This species is exploited in much of its range by hook-and-line, spear and fish trapfisheries. It isconsumed as food, but there is significant risk for ciguatera poisoning (Randall 1980, Heemstra and Randall 1993). Its importance in the live reef food fish trade (LRFFT) is reportedly increasing (Sattar and Adams 2005). It is also collected for the aquarium trade."

Spawning aggregations are targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, and it has been subjected to increasing fishing pressure over the past 10-20 years in large parts of southeast Asia to supply the chilled and live reef fish food trade centred in Hong Kong. According to fisheries data, significant population declines have occurred in the Philippines. Prior to the implementation of several conservation measures that reduced fishing effort on this species, declines had also been detected in Australia, but the population is now considered to be stable or increasing according to stock assessments. Data are limited elsewhere in its range, but declines are likely to occur where heavy fishing effort for groupers is present. Considering the export trade in this species is generally increasing (e.g., in Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia), the chance that declines will either increase and/or continue outside of Australia, is likely to occur in the future. Global-level declines approaching the thresholds for Near Threatened or a threatened category have not yet been detected; therefore, it is listed as Least Concern with a strong recommendation to reduce fishing effort and improve fisheries monitoring and management. Protection of spawning aggregations should be considered a high priority for conservation action.The change in status from the previous assessment reflects an improved application of the Red List categories and criteria, as well as a better understanding of available data.","This speciesis distributed in the western Pacific from southern Japan to Australia (Queensland and Western Australia) and from Thailand and Malaysia eastward to the Solomon Islands, Caroline Islands and Fiji. Records from the Western Indian Ocean are likely based on misidentifications of P. laevis. Its depth range is 3-100 metres.","This species can be quite abundant in un-fished areas, the highest recorded is about 10 fish per hectare in Australia, while it is relatively naturally uncommon in the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Populations of this species show clear evidence of sub-structuring according to mitochondrial data (K. Ma unpublished data), with a strong genetic break between East Indonesia and the Torres Strait and between Palau and the Great Barrier Reef. A market survey conducted in the Solomon Islands in 2015-2016, observed 403 individuals of this species, 55% were immature, total length ranged from 18-74 cm andrepresented 7.4% of the grouper catch (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). A markey survey conducted in Pohnpei in 2005 recorded only 5 individuals of this species out of 1,847 groupers, and in 2015, no individuals of this species were recorded out of 2,969 groupers (K. Rhodes pers. comm. 2016). Five spawning aggregation sites are known from Sabah, Malayasia (SCRFA 2003), and four were still present in 2001/2002 while one had been extirpated due to reef destruction from cyanide fishing. Most recent FAO data suggest global landings to be increasing since about 2006 and to be at about 20,000 mt for 2012-2013. Of this, the live trade<span style=''>official Hong Kong import datais about 4,000 mt although this is thought to significantly underestimate the trade which could be double that; the live trade comprises a significant proportion of global trade in the species (ADMCF report in review). The major source countries for international tradeare Indonesia and Philippines; although Malaysia appears to be exporting significant volumes, and landings of Plectropomus species have increased three-fold in Indonesia in the last decade. Philippines: In some areas in the Philippines, the species forms a single species fishery for the live reef fish export market. Catch and export figures reveal a fishery that was once large but has declined rapidly (43% over four years), average fish size has declined, catch rates appear low, and mortality estimates are high (Padillaet al. 2003). In addition, fisher surveys found that more fish were taken when they had eggs, and fish were noted by divers to be in groups (SCRFA 2003); the fishery also targets immature fish when most mature size fish have gone and often grows out the immature fish to a larger, market size in floating net pens – referred to as ‘mariculture’.According to interviews with fishers and fisheries officials conducted in 2016in Palawan , daily catch rates and sizes declined substantially over the last decade or so, from several tens of kg of market-sized fish per fisher per day in the 1980s to just a couple of kg in recent times (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2016). The density of this species at Hart Reef in Palawan is very low, and by comparison, is at least one order of magnitude less than densities in Australia (e.g., density varied from 2.6-9 fish per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> on the Great Barrier Reef to less than one fish per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> in the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea).A preliminary yield per recruit analysis indicated this species was substantially overfished in the last decade, although the model had some uncertainty associated with it (Yin 2014). The Philippines’ Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) implemented an observer program at landing ports in 1999. Since then, landings of this species were documented annually, except for 2000. Overall, landings of this species fluctuated between 172 and 2,400 kg with no clear trend until 2011, and from 2012-2015, landings increased to 28,100 kg and then declined to 12,000 kg in 2016 (BFAR-NFRDI 2017). Australia: This species is common and abundant on the Great Barrier Reef, with densities ranging from 3.5 to 9 fish per 1,000 m² (Ayling and Ayling 1992, Aylinget al.2000). According tomark-recapture studies, the estimated population of this species on the reef area around Lizard Island is between 1,890 to 2,134 fish (area of 750,966 m<sup>2</sup>), which is equivalent to 2.6 fish per 1,000 m<sup>2</sup> (Zeller and Russ 2000, Samoilys and Carlos 2001). Underwater video surveys conducted from 2005 to 2009 in both shallow and deep sites across four geographically-separated groups of islands observed a total of 1,542 individuals of this species and it occurred in77% of the camera deployments. The relative abundance of this species changed very little in ﬁshed areas during the course of the study, despite the implementation of ﬁsheries restrictions on groupers. In areas closed to ﬁshing, 12–32% of this individuals of this species were larger than the minimum legal size for retention (45 cm total length), and in areas open to fishing, 6-15% were larger than legal size. Underwater surveys recently conducted in protected and unprotected areas indicated that abundance was lower in unprotected areas 1.3-5.7 fish/hectare than in protected areas 1.2-9 fish/hectare (H. Choat pers. comm. 2016). This species is taken in commercial ﬁsheries in Australia, predominantly on the Great Barrier Reef, and it comprises at least 80% of thePlectropomuscatch (Samoilyset al. 2002, Mapstoneet al. 2004). Commercial log book data collected since 1989 show increases in catch and effort ofPlectropomusspecies on the Great Barrier Reef, followed by declines due to the introduction of a total allowable catch in 2004of 1,288 mtthat reduced catch (Samoilys 2012). In the mid-1990s, exports of live individuals of this species from Australia primarily to Hong Kong increased, but has declined since. Despite extensive ﬁsheries and protected area controls (including no-ﬁshing areas, size limits, partial aggregation closures and quotas), signiﬁcant abundancedeclines in the central and southern sections of the Great Barrier Reef were reported (Aylinget al.2000). One major spawning aggregationdisappeared on the Great Barrier Reef probably due to targeted fishing (Samoilyset al. 2001, Samoilys 2012). The 50% increase in the number of active commercial boats in the ﬁshery, the decline in catch rate since the early 1990s and GBRMPA’s recognition that their zoning was inadequate and not representative, led to substantial reviews and revision of legislation in the early 2000s. In 2004, three 9-day closures were implemented to protect spawning aggregations (Turnbull and Samoilys 1997). Illegal ﬁshing is considered to be the primary cause of declining abundance of this species inside closed-area boundaries (Mcleanet al.2011). The effect of the temporary spawning closures was not monitored by the government, so there are no data to support or refute their effectiveness (Samoilys 2012). Studies on the effects of these closures show that after 1.5-2 years of protection, the density of this species increased by a factor of 1.7 in areas that had been closed to ﬁshing in 2004, while density and biomass decreased slightly in the areas that remained open to ﬁshing (Evans et al. 2006, Russ et al. 2008).According to an assessment of the Great Barrier Reef fishery, the stock was stable from 2004 to 2015 (Leighet al.2015). Independent monitoring of two spawning aggregations provides some evidence that the permanent closures has maintained one aggregation and the temporary spawning closures have not been sufficient to protect another (M. Samoilys,B. Russell, Roelofs and Pears in prep.).In Western Australia, the recreational ﬁshery is managed through minimum size limits, bag limits and area closures and is not considered overexploited (Nardiet al. 2004).",decreasing,"This species inhabits coral reefs (Goeden 1978, Heemstra and Randall 1993, Kailolaet al.1993). Juveniles typically occur shallower than adults, especially around coral rubble (Doherty et al. 1994, Adams et al. 2000). Recruitment of juveniles appears to be largely driven by current patterns and geomorphology (Doherty et al. 1994).It primarily consumes fish and crustaceans (St. John 1999) and its maximum total length is 120 cm (Craig et al. 2011).This is a relatively fast-growing, early-maturing, diandric protogynous grouper that forms seasonal spawning aggregations (Samoilys 1997, J. Pet pers. comm.).Aggregation sites are typically located on their home reef (Zeller 1998) with some localized movements (Zeller and Russ 1998), although spawning may also occur outside of aggregations (Samoilys 2012). In Fiji, small groupings of this species are found regularly in certain seasons and the groupings tend to be somewhat dispersed particularly along the outer reef-edge and well-developed inner reefs (SCRFA 2003). In Cairns on the Great Barrier Reef, maximum aggregation density has been recorded as 75 fish/1,000 m<sup>2</sup>, and the average non-aggregation density is 6.5 fish/1,000 m<sup>2</sup>(Samoilys 1997).Spawning occurs in small groups of about 60-130 individuals on the northern Great Barrier Reef (Samoilys 1997), an aggregation of 30 fish was noted in Taytay, Palawan, Philippines (SCRFA Newsletter No. 9, page 10, www.scrfa.com), 20-30 fish were observed in eastern Malaysia (Cornish and Kiwi 2004) and aggregations of hundreds of fish have been observed in parts of Indonesia (H. Perumo pers. comm.).Sex ratios and expression of sexual pattern can vary somewhat geographically (Carteret al.2014). It has been aged to14-19 years with a maximum fork length of about 65 cm on the Great Barrier Reef (Ferreira and Russ 1994, DPI 2002) and to 18 years at about 55 cm total length in the Philippines, where it appears to have a slower growth rate (Mamauag 1997). Age atﬁrst maturity is 2-3 years at 32–36 cm fork length (Ferreira 1995), but mature individuals ranging in fork length from 20-25 cm have been observed elsewhere (Samoilys 2000).In the Philippines, sexual maturation occurs at about 38-39 cm fork length (Ferreira 1995,Adamset al.2000, WWF 2011, Pallaet al.2012) with female to male sex transition occurring at 3-5 years of age or possibly older (Adamset al. 2000, Craiget al. 2011).Natural mortality has been estimated in Australia as 0.147 (Russ et al. 1998).Based on a longevity of 19 years, age of first maturity of 2 years, and applying the mean generational turnover formula in Depczynski and Bellwood (2006), one generation length is estimated to be 10.5 years.",Targeted fishing of spawning aggregations is a major threat to this species.,"Species-specific conservation measures are mainly present only in Australia (Samoilys 2012), and include minimum size limits, recreational bag limits, total allowable catch limits and seasonal fishing closures during spawning (Turnbull and Samoilys 1997, Russell 2003). Charter ﬁshing operators are regulated by permits.The commercial Queensland ﬁshery is managed by the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries under the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery Management Plan, and regulations includelimited entry, license requirements, gear restrictions, quotas and a minimum size limit of 38 cm total length (Ferreira 1995). About 20% of the reefs in the Great Barrier Reef are closed to fishing (Great Barrier Reef Marine Protected Area website). Studies on the impacts of these closures indicate that generally higher densities are recorded on unﬁshed reefs (Evans and Russ 2004), and females are larger, older and more abundant on closed reefs, which suggests reef closures are an effective strategy (Vincent and Sadovy 1998, Adams et al. 2000). A massive re-zoning of the Great Barrier Marine Park in 2004, resulted in 33% of the park being closed to ﬁshing (Fernandes et al. 2005). In 2008, two 5-day closures around the new moon in October-Novemberbecame effective in 2009-2013. The Houtman Albrolhos Islands in Western Australia were declared a Fish Habitat Area by the Department of Fisheries, and 17% of this area was closed to ﬁshing in 1994. After 8 years of closure this species increased by three to sevenfold due to reduced ﬁshing mortality (Nardi et al. 2004). Although there are many marine parks in Japan, no protected areas exist to protect groupers (A. Nakazono pers. comm. 2003).","In Australia, this species is exploited in hook-and-line commercial ﬁsheries and in recreational ﬁsheries by handline, rod and speargun on both the Great Barrier Reef and in the Houtman Albrolhos Islands. Artisanal ﬁsheries in Fiji and New Caledonia take this species by hook-and-line and speargun, and incidentally by trap and net. It is sometimes taken using cyanide in the Philippines and Indonesia.This species is highly-valued and sold in both the live and chilled reef fish food trade, which is centred in Hong Kong (Lau and Parry-Jones 1999, ADM Capital Foundation in review 2016). The export of live individuals of this species is a signiﬁcant commercial ﬁshery in the Asia-Paciﬁc region, with ﬁsh now being primarily sourced from Indonesia and the Philippines (Samoilys 2012). Larvae have been reared experimentally from eggs and sperm sourced from spawning aggregations on the Great Barrier Reef (Rimmer et al. 1994), Japan and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Commercial-scale production has been recently reported from Hainan Island off mainland China; however, no data are available on production and there have been problems in ensuring the red body colouration in cultured ﬁsh, which ensures a high market value (Y. Sadovy de Mitcheson pers. comm.). As such, there is continued interest in sourcing the species from the wild (either as an adult or grow-out of juveniles in captivity) to ensure the favoured red coloration (Sadovy and Pet 1998). In the Philippines, most fish were wild-caught at export size, but are increasingly being caught as juveniles and then grown to market size (Sadovy de Mitcheson 2016)."

It is taken in mixed-species fisheries throughout its range, and is directly targeted in parts of its range for its swim bladder, which can fetch a very high price in international markets. It can live to 15 years of age and forms large spawning aggregations, which are targeted by commercial and artisanal fishers. Overfishing has been documented in the South China Sea, Arabian Sea, Northern Territory waters (Australia), and local declines reported from West Papua.

Recent biomass and egg production were estimated at 28% of unfished levels (Northern Territory Government 2016), down from the 62% biomass and 38% egg production of unfished levels reported in the 2011 stock assessment (Northern Territory Government 2015, Grubert et al.2013). This yields an estimated 98% decline in biomass over three generations (28.5 years). The minimum size at first maturity for females in Phelan et al. (2008) (79 cm TL)was much smaller than the 92 cm TL reported previously in Queensland waters. Mature individualscomprised only a small component of fished species in a 1999-2000 sampling program (Phelanet al.2008). In the Northern Peninsula Area (Australia), 96% of the catch in 1999 taken between April and August and 89% of the catch in 2000 taken between May and September was comprised of this species. Catch numbers in 1999 and 2000 exceeded 50 individualsper boat with CPUE peaking at 224.5 kg boat per hour (Phelanet al. 2008). Total annual catch of this species in Northern Territory waters peaked at about 600 t in 2004/2005 and decreased to just over 200 t by 2010 (estimated 99% decline over three generations). While spatially averaged CPUE for the same time period has fluctuated, the long term trend is decline (Grubert et al. 2013).Based on its capture volumes, the species was probably abundant in India and Australia. In northwest coast off Saurasshtra, India, the total catch ofthis speciesin February, 2003 was about 315.2 kg, contributing 8.6% of all marine fish harvested in the month (Vijayan et al.2003). In Palk Bay, India, the annual catch ofthis speciesby trawlers contributed to about 20% of all croaker catches from 1988 to 1992 (Jayasankar 1997).In the trawl fishery of Gujarat this speciesformed 3 % of sciaenid composition during 2016 (CMFRI 2017).Off Vanakbara, India, annual catch of this species increased in the early 2000s to 1,342.8 t in 2005 and subsequently decreased to 788 t in 2007 (estimated 95% decline over three generations). CPUE was highest in 2005 at 3.1 kg/h<sup>-1</sup>(Ghosh et al.2010). This species contributed 5% (8,600 t) to the sciaenids during 1999 - 2007 in India (M. Gurusaranam pers. comm. 2009).Cheung and Pitcher (2008) showed the CPUE of this species had declined over 90% from mid-1970s to late 80s in the northern South China Sea, which is probably due to over fishing. According to Thailand Fisheries Statistics, the catching rate might be stable; however, this species is not a large catch and more data on biology are needed (J. Sommai pers. comm. 2016). Anecdotal evidence also suggests declines in Saudi Arabia (Abdulrahman Ben-Hasan pers. comm. 2019).The documented declines (average = ~94% decline) only occur in about a quarter of its range, although declines are strongly suspected elsewhere, therefore, total decline over the past three generations is estimated to be about 24%.",decreasing,"This species is found in coastal waters over mud bottoms to depths of 60 m (Lal Mohan 1984) and is also known to ascend into tidal rivers and estuaries on occasion (Sasaki 2001). This isa long-lived, predatory species (Phelan et al. 2008) and feeds mainly on crustaceans and small fishes. The maximum recorded total length is 150 cm (Sasaki 2001).The reproduction season is from May to October (Shen et al. 2007) with spawning grounds in western Taiwan (Waisanding Sand Bar) associated with adjacent waters to rivers in the southwestern coast (H.K. Mok pers. comm. 2016). There are limited data regarding longevity and reproductive period for this species in Thailand but biologists from India report that it matures at 85 cm SL at around 3-4 years of age (J. Sommai pers. comm. 2009). Size at first maturity is 92 cm TL (McPherson 1997) and age at first maturity around 4 years (Bray 2019). This species may undertake seasonal migrations dependent on food availability (Thomas and Kunja 1981) or may be related to reproduction (Dhawan 1971); however, inshore aggregations observed in Phelan et al.(2008), were comprised of mostly of individuals below the mature size-classes. This could be an indication that aggregations are not specific to spawning or that larger breeding individuals have been fished down (Phelan et al. 2008). This species can live to at least 15 years of age (Phelanet al. 2008).Generation length for this species is about 9.5 years. This was calculated using the following equation: Age at first maturity + (max age - age at first maturity ) / 2","This species is threatened by overexploitation in parts of its range. This species forms spawning aggregations which are targeted by subsistence, recreational and commercial fisheries. In the northern Arabian Sea andBay of Bengal, it was previously taken incidentally in mixed-species fisheries, but direct targeting of this species occurred in response to the high price of the swimbladder (Dutta et al. 2014). There is a high juvenile exploitation for the species in northern Arabian Sea and the mean size in the fishery was 373 mm (CMFRI 2015). There are now widespread concerns that the resource is being overexploited (Phelan et al. 2008)but data are limited. There is anecdotal evidence that the annual aggregations of this species along the east coast of Queensland have been reduced as a result of intense fishing activities (Bowtell 1995, 1998). This species is tarted by local fisherman in West Papua where localized declines have been reported as a result of overfishing (USAID 2019).","Species specific conservation on the species has been conducted in NPA, Australia, in 2001 and 2002 with a 2-year fishing moratorium (Phelan et al. 2008). Surveys at aggregation sites in 2002 and 2003 established that much larger fish (mean size 103.5 cm TL) were again present on the aggregation grounds, albeit in very low numbers. These preliminary results highlight the critical need for continued monitoring and management of this fishery in the NPA. Given the demand for maw of this species, a two fish per angler regulation has also been implemented (N.L. Chao pers. comm. 2019).In South and East China Seas, Yellow Sea, mainland China, the fishing moratorium for prohibiting the trawlers between May and August could possibly protect those species that mainly caught by trawlers, if effectively enforced. In India, mechanized fishing is limited by law (MFRAs) in nearshore areas and there is a seasonal fishing ban from June 15<sup>th</sup>to July 31<sup>st</sup>each year in the west coast and April 15<sup>th</sup>to June 15<sup>th</sup>in the east coast, that may benefit this species, although there are no supporting data and the level of enforcement is not known.","The species is an important food fish and is caught with bottom trawls, handlines, and gillnets. This species is commercially fished and farmed in aquaculture.It is highly valued and is sold fresh, dried salted and the swim bladder dried (Lal Mohan 1984,Manmatha and Rahman 1991, Kong 1998). It is particularly highly valued for its swim bladder (Dutta et al. 2014,Sadovy de Mitcheson et al.2019) (there is a long history of swim bladder use from this species and more valuable swim bladders are generally the largest and thickest and hence particularly sought after from large croakers which may have such characteristics).It is one of the largest sciaenids caught in Sabah and is more frequently seen in the East Coast markets of Sandakan and Tawau. This species is also targeted in Bintuni Bay, West Papua by local fisherman and can fetch high market price (USAID 2019). The species forms annual spawning aggregations in inshore northern Australian waters where it is targeted by subsistence and recreational fishers (Phelan 2008). Indigenous fishers of the Cape York Northern Peninsula Area (NPA) reported that large adult individuals made up the majority of the catch from the aggregations until about 1994. More recently, sexually mature individuals comprised only a small component (1999–2000) (Phelanet al.2008).In Australia, juvenile mulloway were reared using intensive hatchery techniques (Fielder 1999). Artificial propagation and breeding of this species were studied in China, including the effects of salinity, feeding habits, growth, cupric sulphate, formalin and so on in the larvae, juvenile and fry (Lin 2004, Shiet al. 2004, Zhanget al. 2004, Linet al.2005, Linet al. 2006, Yanet al. 2006, Zhanget al.2006a, 2006b).This is one of the dominant fish species caught by the gill net of the northern Arabian Sea (Indian) (Manojkumar 2007) and Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh (India, annual catch of about 22.5 t) (Sivakami and Ramalingam 2003)."

It is moderately- to heavily-exploited throughout the majority of its range, often indirectly through multi-species demersal trawl fisheries and gill-netting. Current population data are extremely limited. For example, landings data are not reported for this species in different parts of its geographic range where it is fished. Globally, reported landings have increased steadily since the mid-1970s. Regionally, declines or disappearances of this species have been reported (e.g., in the Gulf of Thailand and Persian Gulf). In India, reported landings have increased recently, following a period of decline and stability; however, recent increases have been in conjunction with increasing fishing effort, rendering it difficult to interpret any changes in population. At this time, quantitative data required to determine population trends are not available and therefore this species is listed as Data Deficient. However, this species has various characteristics that increase its susceptibility to population declines resulting from high fishing pressure, including large size and late maturity. Research is urgently needed to determine the population status of this species in the face of likely continued increases in fishing pressure. Furthermore, given the presumed susceptibility of this species to declines as a result of heavy fishing pressure, monitoring and evaluation that would lead to fisheries management are recommended.","This species iswidely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, from the Persian/Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea to South Africa, east to Indonesia, north to Taiwan and south to northern Australia (Stauch and Cadenat 1965, Hensley 2001, Manilo and Bogorodsky2003, Joshi et al. 2016, Fricke et al. 2018).

Globally, landings of this species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization have increased from around 5,000 t in the mid-1970s to 25,000-30,000 t presently (FAO 2018).In India, reported landings of Indian Halibut are variable, increasing from about 1,500 t in 1985 to more than 3,500 t in 1995, followed by a decline to about 1,000 t by 1999 (CFMRI 2019). After a period of relative stability around 1,000 t, landings increased in recent years to around 2,500 t (CFMRI 2019). However, demersal trawl effort has increased over the time series, such that landings are not an appropriate proxy for population status.Indian Halibut stocks in the Gulf of Thailand disappeared due to the rapid expansion of trawl fisheries (Suvapepun 1991), though previous work suggested that this species can remain resilient after being subject to fishing pressure given time (Pauly 1980). From 1984-2009, landings exhibited a continuous decline in the Gulf of Thailand (Koolkalya et al. 2015). It was not recorded in surveys of fish landing centers around Vembanad Lake, Kerala, India in 2012-2013, though it was present there in the late 1980s (Asha et al. 2014, Maitra et al. 2018).",unknown,"<span class='sheader51'>Thisdemersal, marine species inhabits the soft substrates of nearshore and estuarine environments.

The reported longevity is 4-6 years and age at maturity is 1 year (Pauly 1994); thus, generation length is probablyless than 3 years.","This species is moderately to heavily exploited in a variety of multi-species fisheries, including demersal trawl and gill-net and is frequently taken as bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries (e.g., Paighambari and Daliri 2012, Eighani andPaighambari 2013). Further, its large maximum size (to &gt; 60 cm: Hensley 2001, Gilanshahiet al. 2012) and size at maturity (35-45 cm: Pradhan 1962, Ramanthan and Natarajan 1979, Pauly 1994) probablycontribute to a high susceptibility to declines resulting from overexploitation. As a shallow-water species, and one that frequently occurs in estuaries, it is also likely to be negatively impacted by degradation of these sensitive habitats.","No species-specific conservation measures are in place; however, its range overlaps with a number of marine protected areas, including the Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, India (Nammalwaret al.2013, Joshi et al. 2016, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). In addition, due to the overexploitation of the demersal fishery resources, many countries of the Persian Gulf have implemented conservation measures such as fishing licenses, regulation of fishing gear and capture size, closing fishing areas, restricting fishing season, and banning fish trawling; however, enforcement and management may be lacking (Siddeek et al. 1999).It was regionally assessed as Data Deficient in the Persian Gulf.","Indian Halibut is marketed fresh and is valued for its domestic consumption and export values (Hensley 2001, Gilanshahiet al. 2012)."

Adults primarily occur in schools near the sea bed on the continental shelf while juveniles usually inhabit bays and estuaries and shallow continental shelf waters (May and Maxwell 1986, Kailola et al.1993).Young use suction feeding to prey mainly on invertebrates and small fish that live in the sand and algae (Sazima 1998, Afonoset al.2008).The maximum recorded length for this species is 82 cm fork length (FL), but commonly to 40 cm FL (Smith-Vaniz 2002).

There were no differences in the maturation or length-weight relationships between sexes. The spawning season lasts from June to September. Fish undergo the maturation process throughout late winter and spring, and become sexually active in June. It is an annual spawner that likely releases gametes in multiple events during the summer. It forms spawning aggregations around the summits of offshore reefs. It may also exhibit a surface spawning behaviour (Afonso et al. 2008).","Pseudocaranx dentex is an important commercially exploited species in the eastern Atlantic. It is likely susceptible to overfishing when it forms spawning aggregations over offshore reefs, as has been observed in anecdotal fishing information in the Azores (Afonso et al. 2008). However, there are no known major threats to its global population.", There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for this fish.,"This species is commercially important in New South Wales, Australia in the ocean haul, trap and line, and trawl fisheries (Scandol and Rowling 2007).Itis taken as bycatch in commercial bottom trawl and Danish seine fisheries in New Zealand (Marchalet al.2008).In the western Atlantic,P. dentex is taken incidentally on handlines usingCaranx crysos as bait. It is caught in fish traps in Bermuda (Smith-Vaniz 2002). In the eastern Atlantic, this species sustains a large fishery where it is sold in markets. Catch is not reported separately and Carangid species are mainly caught in the inshore fishery using purse seines in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. It is also used in aquaculture in some parts of its range (Nibe et al.2010). Based on the CECAF south working group (2009), which covers Guinea Bissau to Angola, catch landings forCarangidae spp. from 1994-2008 increased to 20,000 tonnes in 2001, remained stable until 2008, and then declined to 12,000 tonnes (not all countries are reported).Aggregate catch data for carangids, jacks, crevalles nei in the Eastern Central Atlantic from 1950-2010 indicate an increasing trend in catch with a peak in 1978 at 42,174 tonnes. Catch subsequently declined by 46% (at 22,821 tonnes) by 1980. Landings fluctuated between 1981-1999.

Biological productivity may be limited by small litter sizes, although it is relatively fast-growing with females reaching maturity at five years of age. The Crocodile Shark is a regular bycatch in pelagic swordfish and tuna longline fisheries, but is usually discarded by commercial fleets. The previous assessment inferred population reductions from reductions in larger co-occurring sharks resulting in a Near Threatened assessment. However, encounters and catch rates of Crocodile Shark in pelagic longline fisheries have been increasing over time. It is uncertain whether this is a result of the shifting nature of fisheries, or the possibility of mesopredator release. While this needs further confirmation, the Crocodile Shark is widespread, appears to be increasing in abundance, and is assessed as Least Concern. Due to the high overlap between the species' range and pelagic fisheries, together with its limited biological productivity, catch rates and population trends should continue to be monitored.","The Crocodile Shark is circumglobal in oceanic waters of the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).","There is a high degree of genetic flow between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, however, further studies are required to determine population connectivity throughout the rest of the species' range (da Silva Ferrette et al. 2015).

Crocodile Shark encounters and catch rates in pelagic longline fisheries have been increasing over time (Romanovet al.2008).Increases in catches may be reflective of the shifting nature of the fisheries, as there are several factors shown to affect catch rates including fishing gear depth, bottom depth, and moon phase, or possibly mesopredator release as larger pelagic predators have been removed from the system (Romanovet al.2008). It is unlikely that increasing catches of Crocodile Shark were a result of any shifts between fishing at night (for swordfish) versus during the day (for tuna) as 'Time of day' was not found to be an important explanatory variable on catch rates (Romanovet al.2008).",increasing,"The Crocodile Shark is an epi- and mesopelagic species recorded from the surface to depths of at least 590 m (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).

Reproduction is oophagous with litter sizes of four pups (Oliveira et al. 2010, Dai et al. 2012).

Hook mortality of Crocodile Sharks can be low (13%; Coelho et al. 2012).

Given the absence of an international management body, further monitoring of this species is needed on the national level, in addition to species-specific data on landings, effort and population status.","This Indo-West Pacific species is found from the Red Sea and East Africa to Indonesia, north to the Ryukyu Islands and China, south to Australia, Melanesia and Samoa. It entered the eastern Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal (Collette 1970).","Catches of the three species of Rastrelliger are not usually recorded separately. Reported worldwide landings show gradual increase for all three Rastrelliger species, with combined reported landings increasing from 200,000 tonnes in 1950 to over 800,000 tonnes in 2006 (FAO 2009).In India, from 1993-1999, annual average catch was around 200,000 tonnes but has declined to 90,000 tonnes (Johannan and Nair 2002). In one region of Mangalore-Malpe, Karnataka in Eastern India, this species is considered at to be exploited at levels higher than optimum, indicating greater fishing pressure than sustainable levels (Rohit and Gupta 2004). Other studies (Abdussamad et al. 2010) report that since the species mature at an early age and spawn round the year, present fishing pattern appears to have no adverse impact on recruitment, and currently the resource is exploited near the optimum level and there appears to be no immediate threat for the stock.",unknown,"This species occurs in coastal bays, harbors and deep lagoons, usually in some turbid plankton-rich waters. A common, coastal pelagic species, often found in large schools. Off India, batch spawning extends from March through September. It feeds on phytoplankton (diatoms) and small zooplankton (cladocerans, ostracods, larval polychaetes, etc.). Small groups were seen eating eggs of Cheilio inermis straight after their spawnings. Adult individuals feed on macroplankton such as larval shrimps and fish.There are many reports on life history and other information for this species compared to other Rastrelliger species (Noble and Geetha 1992). Size at first maturity is approximately17–20 cm (Tampubolon and Merta 1987, Sivadas et al. 2006), and longevity is estimated to be approximately four years (Mehanna 2001).","This species is highly commercial, and is caught with a number of different gears including purse-seines, fish corrals, gill-nets, cast and drift nets, and by dynamiting. It is marketed fresh, frozen, canned, dried salted and smoked (Collette 2001). Worldwide reported landings of Rastrelliger species are increasing, and although there is no information on effort, it is also assumed to be increasing.","There are no species-specific conservation measures. Although landings are increasing, without information on effort, it is not known if current fishing activities are affecting population abundance. Better reporting is needed to determine species specific landings if possible. Additionally, given the high combined landings for this species and unknown level of effort and the absence of an international management body, further monitoring of this species is needed on the national level.",This species is important in commercial and artisanal fisheries throughout its range.

In Australia, Whitley (1931) described Roughleyia (=Rhabdosargus) tarwhine to distinguish the eastern Australian species from the east African species. Then Munro (1949) reviewed the genus in Australia and confirmed the name Rhabdosargus sarba for the west and east Indian, and west Pacific Ocean populations. Whitley (1964) persisted with the subspecies status as Rhabdosargus sarba tarwhine for the Australian population, but this was not followed by others. The taxonomy of the Rhabdosargus sarba complex is currently under review by Yukio Iwatsuki, (Miyazaki University, Japan), Phil Heemstra, (South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, South Africa) and Tom Trnski, (Auckland Museum, New Zealand).Rhabdosargus sarba might be confused with R. haffara. Taxonomic review is urgently needed (Y. Iwatsuki pers comm. 2013)."," Global Rhabdosargus sarbais widely distributed throughout the western Indo-Pacific and is relatively common in shallow marine and estuarine environments throughout its distribution. There are undoubtedly areas of localized depletion through habitat destruction and/or overfishing but overall this species cannot be considered as being under threat. However, there is evidence to suggest that the species R. sarba may consist of a number of genetically distinct populations, such as the form found off eastern Australia and that found off southern Africa. Further taxonomic work is currently underway in this regard. This species is listed as Least Concern. Persian Gulf Rhabdosargus sarbais overexploited in the Persian Gulf. Landings in the region have decreased and fluctuated significantly within the past decade. With these trends likely to continue, this species is conservation dependent. It is therefore listed as Near Threatened in the region.","Rhabdosargus sarba is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific and is known from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to Eastern Cape, South Africa, eastwards to the South China Sea and Japan, and southwards to Australia (Heemstra and Heemstra 2004), though it is absent from the southern coastline of Australia (D. Pollard pers. comm. 2009). This species is not found on the eastern side of Taiwan (K. Shao pers. comm. 2009). This species occurs to 50 m depth (van der Elst 1993).","There is a high degree of fragmentation within theRhabdosargus sarbacomplex with limited information on population or stock status throughout its distribution.In South Africa,Rhabdosargus sarbawas assessed in KwaZulu-Natal and it was found that the adult stock was not overexploited (SB/R = 63%, F=0) before 2002; however, data from a per-recruit analysis conducted for the KwaZulu-Natal coast indicate that the stock is overexploited and has been reduced to 25–40% of its spawning biomass per recruit while the juvenile stock in estuaries is experiencing high fishing mortality (SB/R = 34%, F=0) (Jameset al.2004). More recent research has shown a decline in the CPUE of the adult population with the closure of the St Lucia estuarine system due to prevailing drought conditions (Mann and Pradervand 2007), which forms an important nursery area for this species (Wallace 1975a). No major changes in CPUE of the adult population have been observed between 2004 and 2012 (Mann 2012). An increase in mean size was recorded in St Lucia MPA between 2001 and 2005 and is attributed to a lack of recruitment into the adult population because of the closure of the St. Lucia mouth (Mann and Pradervand 2007, Mann 2012). There was a substantial decline in percentage composition of shore anglers catches along the KwaZulu-Natal coast between 1994–1996 (2.28%) and 2009–2010 (0.24%) (Mannet al.1997, Dunlop 2011). Decline recorded in the St Lucia MPA between 2001–2005, attributed to closure of St Lucia mouth (Mann 2012). Persian Gulf Grandcourtet al.(2011) compiled size frequency dataforRhabdosargus sarbain the southern Persian Gulffrom commercial catches made off the coast of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates between September 2008 and August 2009.

The fishing mortality was also greater than both biological reference points, target (F<sub>SB40</sub>= 0.22) and limit (F<sub>SB30</sub>= 0.30). Relative spawner biomass per recruit was estimated to be 6.4% of the theoretical unexploited level at the fishing mortality rate0.77 year<sup>-1</sup>, indicating both growth and recruitment overfishing were occurring. Annual Fisheries Statistics Report for Abu Dhabi Emirate (2005-2012) Abu Dhabi Emirate fisheries collected, on average, 52.89 tonnes ofRhabdosargus sarbabetween 2005–2012. A peak of 127.5 tonnes were collected in 2007, followed by a decline to 17.7 tonnes in 2011. There was a slight increase to 24.7 tonnes in 2012.Catches from Bahrain decreased overall from 2009–243.2 tonnes , 2010–171.9 tonnes, to 119.3 tonnes in 2011.This species is not reported from Kuwait (Bishop pers comm. 2013), or Qatar.FAO production statistics from Taiwan mostly come from mariculture.Rhabdosargus sarbais rarely caught in the wild (W. Liao pers. comm. 2009). FAO production figures in 2007 were: Australia (Eastern Indian Ocean) - 2,563 tonnes, (Southwest Pacific) - 215 tonnes, (Western Central Pacific) - 521 tonnes, Japan - 15,600 tonnes, Republic of Korea - 686 tonnes, Taiwan - 1,648 tonnes and New Zealand (Southwest Pacific) 5,919 tonnes.In New South Wales, Australia, between 1995–1996 and 2005–2006, landings averaged ~53 tonnes per year worth an estimated AUUSD 240,000 a year (NSW DPI Catch Statistics).",stable,"Rhabdosargus sarbainhabits a variety of shallow marine habitats including estuaries, the surf zone along sandy beaches, and shallow subtidal reefs (Wallace 1975a, van der Elst 1988, Hesp et al. 2004). Typically adults occupy coastal marine waters where spawning takes place, while juveniles use sheltered estuaries as nursery areas (Wallace 1975a, Hesp et al. 2004). Adults often form schools in estuaries, coastal lakes, bays or exposed reefs (Munro 1949, Hesp et al.2004). In Taiwan, this species inhabits subtidal and muddy habitats and inhabits estuaries/brackish waters as`juveniles (K. Shao pers. comm. 2009).Growth of this species is described in the following equation Lt = 715 mm FL (1-e<sup>-0.16/yr(t+0.996 yrs)</sup>) using sectioned sagittal otoliths in South Africa (Radebe et al. 2002). Age and size varies depending on locality, ranging from 80 cm TL (van der Elst 1993, Heemstra and Heemstra 2004)and 16 years in South Africa (Radebe et al. 2002), to 30.0 cm TL and eight years for the Arabian Gulf (El-Agamy 1989). The maximum age of R. sarba in Western Australia was c. 13 years (Hesp et al. 2004).   Reproduction  Rhabdosargus sarbais described as a protandrous hermaphrodite in South Africa (Garratt 1993,), Hong Kong (Yeung and Chan 1987) and the Persian Gulf (El-Agamy 1989), but has more recently been described as a rudimentary hermaphrodite in Western Australia (Hesp and Potter 2003) and Eastern Australia (Hughes et al.2008). These differences provide further evidence of distinct populations or even species within theR. sarbacomplex. The length at sexual maturity in South Africa was around 26 cm TL (Wallace1975b) and in Western Australia, maturity is attained between 15–21 cm FL (Hugheset al.2008). This speciesspawns from July to November off KwaZulu-Natal in nearshore waters, close to large estuaries and river mouths (Wallace 1975b, Whitfield 1998, Rabebeet al.2002). In Western Australia this species also spawns from July to November, spawning multiple times throughout the season (Hesp and Potter 2003). The age at 50% maturity off KwaZulu-Natal is about 1.8 years and sex change takes place between one and 2.5 years of age (Rabebe et al.2002).Rhabdosargus sarbahas also been reported to move offshore into deeper waters to spawn (Wallace 1975b, Potter and Hyndes 1999).","The main threats to populations ofRhabdosargus sarbainclude habitat destruction (especially of the estuarine habitat), pollution of shallow coastal waters and overfishing (Jameset al.2004).","In South Africa, R. sarbahas been decommercialized to prohibit sale (James et al. 2004) as well as having a bag limit of five fish per person per day and a minimum landing size of 25 cm TL for recreational and subsistence fishers (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 2012). This species is protected in several marine and estuarine no-take MPAs such as iSimangaliso Wetland Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and this has also undoubtedly benefited populations of this species. In New South Wales, the minimum landing size if 20 cm (TL) but it is recommended that the minimum landings size be raised to 22 or 24 cm TL in order to allow 50% or 100% of R. sarbaindividuals to reproduce at least once, respectively (Hughes et al.2008).Rhabdosargus sarbaalso occurs in marine protected areas in other parts of its range including the Shark Bay World Heritage Site in Western Australia (Department of Parks and Wildlife Portal, accessed March 2014, World Database of Protected Areas, accessed March 2014). In Taiwan, a reseeding program has been implemented by the government. The source of stock is unknown (Liao pers. comm. 2009).There is evidence to suggest that the species,R. sarba, may consist of a number of genetically distinct populations, such as the form found off eastern Australia and that found off southern Africa (T. Trnski pers. comm.). Further taxonomic work is currently underway in this regard (Y. Iwatsuki pers. comm.).","Rhabdosargus sarba is utilized in both commercial (El-Agamy 1989) and recreational fisheries (James et al. 2001, Mann et al. 2002), throughout its distribution. In southern Mozambique and northern KwaZulu-Natal R. sarba is harvested in artisanal gill net and trap fisheries (Mann 1995, Kyle 1999). In Western Australia, R. sarbais commonly caught as bycatch by boat and shore-based linefishers in coastal and estuarine systems within the West Coast and South Coast bioregions (Malseed and Sumner 2001, Cusack and Roennfeldt 2002). This species is occasionally targeted by recreational fisheries in some locations including the lower Swan Estuary and in the Cockburn Sound (Hesp 2003). Rhabdosargus sarbais of minor commercial importance in the South Coast bioregion in nearshore estuarine gill net and haul net finfish fisheries (Smith et al. 2012)."

Genetic results indicate that two major subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific, respectively.Pronounced size- and sex-based segregation is present in most of the species’ known coastal feeding areas, with coastal sites typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. The largest known aggregation sites for Whale Sharks host hundreds or low thousands of individuals, based on counts and model estimates. Although individual sharks are highly mobile, many show a degree of site fidelity.Directed fisheries and significant bycatch fisheries have targeted areas where high densities of Whale Sharks occur, leading to rapid reductions in catch per unit effort (CPUE) measures. Some bias toward juvenile Whale Shark-dominated aggregations are present in trend data; in the absence of information on other life-stages, these trends are inferred to be representative of population-level declines. While a number of commercial fisheries for the species closed during the 1990–2000s, Whale Shark products remain valuable and the species is still commonly caught in some countries. Serious injury and inferred mortality through vessel strike is a threat to several globally significant aggregations, as is bycatch in net fisheries, and the risk of ship strike. In the absence of conservation action, declines is likely to continue into the future.Based on count data, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, 75% of the global Whale Shark population is inferred to occur in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. A variety of datasets present declines of 40-92%, inferring an overall decline of 63% in the Indo-Pacific over the last 75 years (three generations), resulting in a subpopulation assessment of Endangered A2bd+4bd. In the Atlantic, the overall population decline is considered to be lower at≥30%, resulting in a subpopulation assessment ofVulnerable A2b+4b. Given the bulk of the global population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, the overall global decline is inferred to be≥50%. Globally, the Whale Shark is therefore assessed as Endangered A2bd+4bd.","The Whale Shark has a circumtropical distribution through all tropical and warm temperate seas, apart from the Mediterranean (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Their core distribution is between approximately 30°N and 35°S, with occasional seasonal penetration to the north and south (Colman 1997, Rowat and Brooks 2012, Sequeira et al. 2014). The northernmost records are from 44°N in the Bay of Fundy, Canada (Turnbull and Randell 2006) and the Sea of Okhotsk off Japan (Tomita et al. 2014), with the southernmost from 37°S in Victoria, Australia (Wolfson 1986). Whale Shark distribution is likely to be temperature limited, as they are rarely sighted in surface temperatures of less than 21°C (Iwasaki 1970, Colman 1997, Duffy 2002, Afonso et al. 2014, Tomita et al. 2014).Areas where 500 or more individuals have been documented through either counts or model estimates include the Arabian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (Robinson et al. in review), Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan et al. 2006, Norman et al. submitted), Darwin Island in the Galapagos (Acuña-Marrero et al. 2014), Quintana Roo in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012), Inhambane province in Mozambique (Norman et al. submitted), the Philippines (Schleimer et al. 2015), and around Mahe in the Seychelles (Rowat et al. 2009, 2011; Brooks et al. 2010). Evidence from fisheries catches indicates that the Gujarat coast of India (Akhilesh et al. 2012), Taiwan (Hsu et al. 2012) and southern China (Li et al. 2012) also had large numbers of Whale Sharks in the vicinity, at least prior to the initiation of targeted fisheries in those countries, with estimated catches of up to 1,000 individuals per year (Li et al. 2012).In the Indian Ocean, data from the tuna purse-seine fleet has identified the Mozambique Channel as having a high density of Whale Shark-associated sets (Sequeira et al. 2012). In the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Whale Shark sightings were correlated with effort (Harley et al. 2013, Sequeira et al. 2014). Modelled habitat suitability was highest in the eastern Atlantic in the area off Gabon and surrounding countries (Sequeira et al. 2014), while the Bismark and Solomon Seas have relatively frequent Whale Shark sightings within the Western and Central Pacific (Harley et al. 2013).","Based on counts, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, it is inferred that approximately 75% of the global Whale Shark population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. In the Indo-Pacific, a population reduction of 63% is inferred over the last three generations (75 years), and in the Atlantic a population reduction of more than 30% is inferred (see the discussion for each subpopulation below). Combining data from both regions, it is likely that the global Whale Shark population has declined by &gt;50% over the last 75 years.Available datasets for Whale Sharks, in particular those from coastal sites, are typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. Acknowledging this, we make the assumption that trend data in the visible fraction of the population (i.e. mainly juveniles) is representative of the adult population. Global population size Whale Sharks are individually identifiable based on their characteristic spot patterns (Taylor 1994, Arzoumanian et al. 2005, Marshall and Pierce 2012). A global database of Whale Shark sightings, comprising submitted photographs from both researchers and the public, is hosted online at Wildbook for Whale Sharks (<a href='www.whaleshark.org'>www.whaleshark.org</a>) (Wild Me 2016, Norman et al. submitted). As of February 2016, there were 7,011 individual sharks on this database, identified from images submitted between 1964 and 2016. However, 70% of sexed individuals (n = 3,420) were male, with the majority of these likely to be immature based on length estimates (Norman and Stevens 2007, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012, Rohner et al. 2015). This dataset is assumed to not fully represent female, small juvenile or adult sharks (Norman et al. submitted). Therefore, the total represents a minimum number of sharks alive over this period.Two global-scale genetic studies on Whale Sharks have estimated genetic effective population size – the number of breeding adults – albeit based on small sample sizes of 70 (Castro et al. 2007) and 68 sharks (Schmidt et al. 2009), respectively. Castro et al. (2007) used mitochondrial DNA to estimate current genetic effective population size to be 119,000–238,000 sharks. Schmidt et al. (2009) estimated genetic effective population size to be 103,572, with a standard error of 27,401–179,794, based on microsatellite analysis. However, lack of knowledge on species-specific mutation rates mean these estimates should not be used for management purposes (J. Schmidt pers. comm., T. Vignaud and S. Planes pers. comm). Global population structure While global connectivity of Whale Shark subpopulations has been postulated (Sequeira et al. 2013b), a large global genetic study using both mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite analysis has demonstrated that the Whale Shark subpopulations in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are functionally separate (Vignaud et al. 2014). Large-scale photo-identification studies in the Indian Ocean (Brooks et al. 2010) and western Atlantic (Hueter et al. 2013), along with Wildbook online database results (Norman et al. submitted), have shown limited connectivity exists between non-contiguous countries. Based on these results, here we have considered two separate subpopulations in this assessment. Atlantic subpopulation trend A decline of ≥30% in the Atlantic subpopulation is inferred over the last three generations (75 years) based on data from tuna fleet observers off a likely centre of abundance for this subpopulation. Between 1980 and 2010 there was a decline in sightings per unit effort (SPUE) off western Africa, with SPUE peaking in 1995 and declining thereafter (Sequeira et al. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, sightings decreased from about 500 during the 1990s to around 150 during the 2000s. Peak-month sightings also declined by approximately 50% over this time (Sequeira et al. 2014).At Gladden Spit in Belize, Whale Shark sightings declined from a mean of 4 to 6 sharks per day between 1998 and 2001 to less than 2 per day in 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), with reports from diving guides indicating that numbers have remained low until 2016 (R. Graham, pers. comm.).In the Azores, there was a significant increase in sightings in 2008 and afterwards compared to the decade before (Afonso et al. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This was strongly correlated with the location of the 22°C isotherm, indicating that this increasing sighting trend is due to environmental conditions (Afonso et al. 2014). Atlantic subpopulation size Regional counts of identified sharks or modelled abundance estimates are available from many of the larger known aggregation or feeding areas. Ramírez-Macías et al. (2012) photo-identified 350 individual Whale Sharks from Holbox Island in Mexico between 2005 and 2008, and estimated that 521–809 sharks participate in this aggregation. Aerial surveys from this area and the adjacent Caribbean coast have counted up to 420 sharks in a single aerial survey (de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011). The largest-known aggregation as of February 2016 occurs seasonally off the Yucatan cost of Mexico, with over 1,100 identified sharks (Norman et al. submitted). Satellite-tagged sharks from this aggregation have been tracked to the northern Gulf of Mexico (Hueter et al. 2013), where aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been reported (Hoffmayer et al. 2005), south to Belize where 106 individual sharks were identified between 1998 and 2003 (Graham and Roberts 2007), and off the island of Utila, Honduras, where 95 sharks were identified between 1999 and 2011 (Fox et al. 2013). One shark, tagged in 2007, was tracked swimming across the equator to the South Atlantic Ocean, near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hueter et al. 2013). The end point of this track was 543 km southeast from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, where 54 Whale Shark sightings were recorded between 2000 and 2005 (Hazin et al. 2008). This individual was subsequently photo-identified back off the Yucatan coast in 2011 and 2012 (Hueter et al. 2013).Aside from St Helena Island (A. Dove, pers. comm.), there have been few photographic records from elsewhere in the Atlantic (Wild Me 2016). There were, however, 2,297 records of Whale Sharks from the logbooks of tuna purse-seine vessels between 1980 and 2010, mostly from the eastern Atlantic (Sequeira et al. 2014) and particularly off the coast of Gabon (Capietto et al. 2014). An additional 1,449 sightings were recorded from the Azores archipelago between 1998 and 2013 (Afonso et al. 2014). Indo-Pacific subpopulation trend A decline of &gt;50% (likely around 63%) in the Indo-Pacific Whale Shark subpopulation is inferredover the last three generations (75 years)based on relevant indices of abundance from Mozambique, the broader Western Indian Ocean, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and the Western and Central Pacific, and actual levels of exploitation in mainland China, the Maldives, India, the Philippines and Taiwan.A commercial fishery for Whale Shark existed in Taiwan until 2007 (Hsu et al. 2012). Information provided by fishers operating from Hongchun harbour in southern Taiwan indicated that 50–60 sharks were caught each season in the mid-1980s, declining to less than 10 per year in each of 1994 and 1995 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). Although definitive catch trends are not available, there was a significant (58%) decrease in the estimated annual catch in 1997 of 272 sharks (Chen and Phipps 2002) to a reported catch of 113 sharks over 15 months in 2001–2002 (Chen and Phipps 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean total length of landed sharks was noted between 2002 and 2007 (Hsu et al. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A decline in the mean size of landed sharks was also noted in southern Chinese waters, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 6.3 m in 2008–2011 (Li et al. 2012; Table 1 in the supplementary material).Data from observers aboard the tuna purse-seine fleet in the Western and Central Pacific noted 1,073 Whale Shark sightings, with most from the Bismark and Solomon Seas (Harley et al. 2013). The occurrence of Whale Shark in free school sets decreased by approximately 50% between 2003 (1%) and 2012 (0.5%), potentially representing a fall in abundance (Harley et al. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material), although a weak linear increase in occurrence probability was modelled by Sequeira et al. (2014) between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, model performance for this latter dataset was poor (Sequeira et al. 2014).The influence of environmental variability on sightings of Whale Shark can complicate the interpretation of trend data, particularly with the shortage of long-term datasets. A decline in Whale Shark sightings along the eastern coast of South Africa between 1993 and 1998 (Gifford 2001) was included in the proposal for listing the sharks on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES 2002). However, with the benefit of hindsight, the substantial variability in sighting data from this area over summer months (Cliff et al. 2007) and seasonal changes in their oceanic distribution (Sequeira et al. 2012), makes it unclear whether these earlier data are indicative of a true subpopulation decline. North of this area, in the northern Mozambique Channel and broader western Indian Ocean, a slight increase in Whale Shark sightings was noted between 1991 and 2000 based on tuna purse-seine vessel data, then a decrease from 2000 to 2007 (Sequeira et al. 2013a; Table 1 in the supplementary material). In absolute terms, 600 sightings were reported from the 1990s decreasing to ~200 across 2000–2007 (Sequeira et al. 2014). Peak monthly sightings decreased by around 50% over the study period (Sequeira et al. 2014). In Inhambane, Mozambique, in the southern Mozambique Channel, sightings declined 79% between 2005 and 2011 (Rohner et al. 2013; Table 1 in the supplementary material). This decreased rate of sightings has persisted to at least January 2016 (S. Pierce, unpubl. data). Sharks routinely move between South Africa and southern Mozambique (Rohner et al. 2015, Norman et al. submitted), but there is limited or no connectivity between these and other known coastal feeding areas to the north in Djibouti, Seychelles and Tanzania (Brooks et al. 2010, Norman et al. submitted). Prior to the species being protected in the Maldives in 1995, catches of Whale Shark declined from around 30 each year from one of the significant fishing locations up until the early 1980s to a catch of 20 or less Whale Sharks from the entire archipelago by 1993 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993; Table 1 in the supplementary material).Two hundred and fifty-three Whale Shark sightings were recorded by a local dive charter company in the Andaman Sea, Thailand, between 1991 and 2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Sightings per unit effort showed a significant decline over this period, with an overall decrease from 1.58 Whale Sharks per trip in 1992–1993 to 0.13 sharks per trip in 2000–2001 (Theberge and Dearden 2006; Table 1 in the supplementary material). A low absolute number of sightings persisted until at least the 2002–2003 season, although effort data were not recorded (Theberge and Dearden 2006). Following the conclusion of data collection for that study, shark sightings have likely increased in frequency according to reports from dive operators. However, sharks are perceived to be smaller than those sighted in the 1990s (P. Dearden, pers. comm).Bradshaw et al. (2008) analysed tourism sightings at Ningaloo Reef, Australia, between 1995 and 2004, corrected for search effort and environmental fluctuation, and identified a 40% decline in sighting rate and a decline in mean shark length of 1.6 m over this time period (Table 1 in the supplementary material), although seasonal shifts in peak abundance to outside observation months may also have contributed to this observed decline (Mau and Wilson 2007, Holmberg et al. 2009). Analysis of individual sighting data from 1995 to 2006 identified behavioural heterogeneity in the sharks at Ningaloo, with the majority showing some site fidelity in that they were sighted in multiple seasons (Holmberg et al. 2008). This (majority) subset of the study population was increasing over the course of this work (Holmberg et al. 2008). Follow-up analyses on a slightly longer dataset (1995 to 2008) confirmed this result, with smaller individuals contributing in larger numbers to recruitment, thereby potentially explaining the observed decline in mean size (Holmberg et al. 2009; Table 1 in the supplementary material). However, a genetic study on Ningaloo sharks indicated declining genetic diversity over five consecutive years for mtDNA (2007–2012) and two (2010–2012) for microsatellites (Vignaud et al. 2014; Table 1 in the supplementary material).Whale Sharks were fished in the Philippines prior to protection in 1998, with Whale Shark catch per unit effort (i.e., per boat) declining from 4.44 to 1.7 in Pamilacan and 10 to 3.8 in Guiwanon between two surveys conducted in 1993 and 1997 (Alava et al. 2002; Table 1 in the supplementary material). Indo-Pacific subpopulation size Six hundred and seventy sharks were photo-identified in southern Mozambique between 2003 and 2014 (Norman et al. submitted). Off Mafia Island in Tanzania, 131 sharks were photo-identified between 2006 and 2014 (Norman et al. submitted). Off Djibouti, 297 individuals were photo-identified between 2003 and 2010 (Rowat et al. 2011), while 443 individuals were photo-identified off Mahe in the Seychelles between 2001 and 2009 (Rowat et al. 2011). A subset of the Seychelles dataset, comprising records from 2004 to 2009, was modelled to produce an abundance estimate of 469 to 557 sharks from that area (Brooks et al. 2010). Comparisons of identities collected from the Seychelles, Djibouti, Tanzania and Mozambique, comprising a total of 1,069 individual sharks sighted up to 2009, found no matches between these countries (Brooks et al. 2010). Norman et al. (submitted) updated these figures and found three international matches (all between Mozambique and Tanzania) from 1,098 individuals. A significant aggregation of juvenile Whale Sharks also occurs in the Red Sea off the Saudi Arabian coast, with 122 individuals identified to 2013 (J. Cochran, pers. comm). Aggregations of up to 100 sharks have been noted off the Qatar coast (Robinson et al. 2013). One hundred and six sharks have been identified around South Ari Atoll in the Maldives (Riley et al. 2010, Davies et al. 2012), with a modelled abundance estimate of around 74 to 104 sharks (Davies et al. 2012). There were 1,184 Whale Shark sightings in the Indian Ocean recorded by tuna purse-seine vessel logbooks between 1991 and 2007, with almost all of these from the Western Indian Ocean (Sequeira et al. 2013a).Eighty-two sightings were recorded off Christmas Island, Australia, between 1996 and 2008 (Hobbs et al. 2009). Whale shark photo-identifications range back to the early 1990s off Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia (Meekan et al. 2006; Holmberg et al. 2008, 2009). Three hundred and eighty-six sharks were identified here between 1995 and 2008 (Holmberg et al. 2009), with over 1,000 sharks identified by 2015 (Norman et al. submitted). Although two satellite-tagged sharks were tracked moving from Ningaloo Reef to the vicinity of Christmas Island (Sleeman et al. 2010), no exchange of photo-identified sharks has been documented to date (Wild Me 2016). One photo-identified Whale Shark was, however, recorded from both Ningaloo Reef and Borneo (B. Norman, unpubl. data).Whale Shark abundance at Ningaloo Reef, Australia has been modelled by two studies. Meekan et al. (2006) estimated super-population size to be 319 to 436 sharks between 1992 and 2004. Holmberg et al. (2009) estimated annual abundance to vary between 86 and 143 sharks in the years 2004 to 2007, when length was used as a covariate. Whale Shark abundance in this area is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index and several other oceanographic variables, which potentially relate to the strength of ocean currents and local productivity (Wilson et al. 2001, Sleeman et al. 2010).Over 820 individual sharks have now been photo-identified from the Philippines (Schleimer et al. 2015), with large aggregations recorded from around Donsol (Quiros 2007), Oslob on Cebu Island (Araujo et al. 2014, Schleimer et al. 2015), and Pintuyan on Southern Leyte (Schleimer et al. 2015). Excluding the Philippines, 326 sharks have been photo-identified from Southeast Asia (here including Cambodia [3], Indonesia [64], Malaysia [32], Myanmar [4], Taiwan [7] and both coasts of Thailand [216]) and added to the global database by February 2016 (Wild Me 2016).In the Eastern Pacific, Whale Sharks are seasonally present in small numbers around Darwin and Wolf islands in the north of the Galapagos Archipelago (Hearn et al. 2013). Acuña-Marrero et al. (2014) identified 82 individuals here from 2011–2013 and estimated an annual study population size of 695±166 individuals for the Galapagos Islands. Males and immature females are rarely observed at this location, so this estimate refers predominantly to large, apparently pregnant females (Acuña-Marrero et al. 2014). Two hundred and fifty-one individual sharks were photo-identified in the Gulf of California, Mexico, between 2003 and 2009: 129 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, 125 from Bahía de La Paz and smaller numbers from other sites (Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012). Modelled abundance estimates from this dataset were 54 in 2008 and 94 sharks in 2009 from Bahía de Los Ángeles, and between 19 and 62 through 2005–2009 at Bahía de La Paz (Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012). Outside of these areas (Galapagos Islands and Mexico), few photo-identified sharks have been added to the global database from the Eastern Pacific (Wild Me 2016). Twenty-five whale sharks were reported from tuna purse-seine vessel observers in 2014 (Clarke 2015).",decreasing,"Whale Sharks are found in both coastal and oceanic habitats (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Oceanic sightings are strongly correlated with temperature in the Indian and Atlantic oceans (Sequeira et al. 2014), with most occurring between 26.5° and 30°C in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira et al. 2012). Depth was an important predictor in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but was not significant in the Indian Ocean (Sequeira et al. 2014). Whale Sharks are highly mobile, with mean daily movement rates of 24–28 km based on tethered geopositioning tags (Hueter et al. 2013). Cyclical or longer-term climate shifts affect Whale Shark occurrence and abundance (Sleeman et al. 2010, Sequeira et al. 2012), which needs to be considered when discussing local abundance trends.Whale Sharks spend the majority of time in the epipelagic zone, but dive to at least 1,928 m in depth (Tyminsky et al. 2015). The driver of these deep dives is unclear, but may be related to foraging behaviour, especially when crossing oceanic waters with comparatively low surface productivity (Sleeman et al. 2010, Brunnschweiler and Sims 2011, Tyminsky et al. 2015) and/or assist with energy conservation when moving between prey zones (Gleiss et al. 2011) or navigating (Tyminsky et al. 2015). Initial results from fatty acid dietary studies suggest that meso- and bathypelagic prey may be an important component of Whale Shark diet (Rohner et al. 2013), and dive data from pop-up archival tags provide some evidence for mesopelagic foraging behaviour (Tyminsky et al. 2015).Most Whale Shark sightings occur at a small number of known coastal feeding areas for the species, where the sharks aggregate on the surface to exploit seasonal productivity such as fish spawning events or zooplankton blooms (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A degree of inter-annual site fidelity has been documented in many locations (Cagua et al. 2015, Norman et al. submitted). Sexual- and size-based segregation is typical in these locations, with a bias towards juvenile males from 4–8 m length (Rohner et al. 2015, Norman et al. submitted). This pronounced segregation indicates that ontogenetic and sex-specific habitat or dietary shifts are present in the species. In the Gulf of California, juvenile sharks, comprising 60% males, were found in shallower waters exploiting abundant prey. Larger sharks, composed of 84% females, occurred in oceanic waters where they fed on diffuse patches of euphasiids (Ketchum et al. 2012). An initial stable isotope study of Indian Whale Sharks showed a positive relationship between size and δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N, suggesting that larger sharks feed on prey items of a larger size and higher trophic level (Borrell et al. 2011). Females had lower values of δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N than males (Borrell et al. 2011) suggesting that they have a different, more pelagic diet, while individuals of &lt;4 m total length (TL) also showed a lower δ13C than larger individuals suggesting a transition from pelagic to more coastal foraging habitats.The largest recorded Whale Shark, approximately 20 m TL (Chen et al. 1997) and 42 t in mass (Hsu et al. 2014), have been reported from Taiwan. An individual extrapolated to be 18.8 m TL was caught in India (Borrell et al. 2011). Norman and Stevens (2007) found that 50% of males were mature, based on clasper morphology, at a visually estimated TL of 8.1 m in Western Australia, while 50% maturity was estimated to occur at 9.2 m TL using laser photogrammetry in Mozambique (Rohner et al. 2015). In the Gulf of Mexico, Ramírez-Macías et al. (2012) visually estimated 50% male maturity to occur at around 7 m TL. Given the genetic differentiation between the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Vignaud et al. 2014), this may represent a subpopulation-level difference in the size of maturation. Size at maturity in female sharks is approximately 9 m TL, based on visual (Acuña-Marrero et al. 2014, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012) and laser photogrammetric estimates (Acuña-Marrero et al. 2014) from the Eastern Pacific, and a 9.6 m TL individual recorded from Taiwan (Hsu et al. 2014). All of seven stranded female specimens from 4.8 to 8.7 m TL in South Africa were immature (Beckley et al. 1997). The only confirmed pregnant female examined, from Taiwan, was 10.6 m TL (Joung et al. 1996).Whale Shark reproductive ecology is poorly known. Pregnant female sharks are seasonally found in the Eastern Pacific, particularly off Darwin Island in the Galapagos Archipelago (Acuña-Marrero et al. 2014) and the Gulf of California (Eckert and Stewart 2001, Ramírez-Macías et al. 2012), but rarely sighted outside this region. An exception is St Helena Island in the mid-Atlantic, where pregnant female sharks are routinely observed on a seasonal basis (A. Dove, pers. comm). The single pregnant female that has been physically examined, from Taiwan, had 304 pups in various stages of development, the largest litter size reported from any shark species (Joung et al. 1996, Schmidt et al. 2010). This discovery established that Whale Sharks are aplacental viviparous. Paternity analysis on a subset of the offspring established that a single male might have sired the entire litter, suggesting that the species has the capacity to store sperm (Schmidt et al. 2010). The largest size class of embryos, 58–64 cm TL, appeared close to fully developed (Joung et al. 1996). The smallest free-swimming neonate found in the wild, from the Philippines, was 46 cm TL (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Size at birth is therefore presumed to be around this range (Aca and Schmidt 2011). Reproductive periodicity is unknown: resightings rarely occur in the areas where pregnant sharks are observed (Norman et al. submitted).Age and growth data on Whale Shark are sparse. Stranded sharks in South Africa (Wintner 2000) and fishery catches in Taiwan (Hsu et al. 2014), respectively, have been assessed. Both studies were limited by small sample sizes of predominantly juvenile sharks. Hsu et al. (2014) concluded that growth band deposition is likely to be biannual and, based on this, estimated that male sharks begin maturing at ~17 years and females at 19–22 years in the Indo-Pacific. However, these estimates have some important caveats: biannual band deposition has been demonstrated in very few other shark species, and other orectolobiform species have been shown to have aperiodic band pair formation (Huveneers et al. 2013). Validation through wild growth studies is important to confirm these results. Initial results from laser photogrammetric studies indicate that growth increments over periods of 1–3 years are too small to be accurately measured, but the technique may have value over longer time-frames (Rohner et al. 2015). Generation length is estimated as 25 years.","Major contemporary threats to Whale Sharks include fisheries catches, bycatch in nets, and vessel strikes. Other threats affect Whale Shark on local or regional scales. Whale Sharks are presently fished in several locations. In southern China, large-scale commercial take of Whale Sharks appears to be increasing (Li et al. 2012). Although Whale Sharks are not necessarily targeted, they are routinely captured and retained when sighted (Li et al. 2012). A small-scale opportunistic fishery for Whale Sharks is also present in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm). Whale Sharks have previously been targeted in large-scale fisheries from India, the Philippines and Taiwan, with hundreds of sharks caught annually in each country until species-level protections were implemented (Rowat and Brooks 2012). A smaller directed fishery occurred in the Maldives until Whale Sharks were protected in 1995 (Anderson and Ahmed 1993). Broader-scale subpopulation reduction caused by these fisheries was raised as a possible driver of declining sightings in Thailand (Theberge and Dearden 2006) and Western Australia (Bradshaw et al. 2008). Occasional directed catch or bycatch of Whale Sharks has been documented from many of their range states, particularly where large-mesh gillnets are in common use (Rowat and Brooks 2012).Tuna are often associated with Whale Sharks, and tuna purse-seine fisheries often use Whale Sharks as an indicator of tuna presence, even setting nets around the sharks (Capietto et al. 2014). Direct mortality in purse-seine fisheries appears to generally be low, recorded as 0.91% (one of 107) and 2.56% (one of 38) of sharks where fate was reported by observers in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively (Capietto et al. 2014). However, estimated mortality rates in the Western Central Pacific purse-seine fishery were higher: 12% for 2007–2009 and 5% in 2010. This extrapolated to a total mortality of 56 sharks in 2009 and 19 in 2010 (Harley et al. 2013). Observer reports on release condition from this region from 2010–2014 were generally consistent, with 50–60% of encircled sharks released alive, 5–10% dying and 30–40% of status unknown (Clarke 2015). Assuming a poor outcome for the latter category, potential mortalities in 2014 range from a minimum of 11 to 42, with a higher number possible depending on longer-term survival of the sharks released alive (Clarke 2015). Available data on the number of Whale Sharks caught are likely to underestimate total catch (Clarke 2015). The longer-term survivorship of Whale Sharks released from nets has not been examined at this stage. Common release practices, such as being lifted or towed by the caudal peduncle, are likely to cause stress, injury and possibly death to the sharks.Shipping lanes, where they are placed close to Whale Shark feeding areas, can create a serious risk of vessel strikes. Whale Sharks routinely feed at the surface (Motta et al. 2010, Gleiss et al. 2013), and propeller injuries are commonly recorded during monitoring programs (Rowat et al. 2006, Speed et al. 2008, Fox et al. 2013). While mortality events are seldom reported in the contemporary scientific literature, they were often noted from slower-moving vessels in the past (Gudger 1941). It is likely that fast-moving, large ships do not register or report impacts, and as Whale Sharks will typically sink upon death, these are unlikely to be documented (Speed et al. 2008). Areas where Whale Sharks appear to be at particular risk include the Mesoamerican reef countries in the Western Caribbean (Graham 2007, R. de la Parra-Venegas pers. comm.) and Gulf states (D. Robinson pers. comm.), where a high frequency of serious propeller injuries are observed during monitoring.Inappropriate tourism may be an indirect threat to Whale Shark in some circumstances (for example from interference, crowding or provisioning). Marine pollution events occurring in Whale Shark hotspots, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Hoffmayer et al. 2005, McKinney et al. 2012), may result in mortality or displacement from preferred habitats. These more local threats, as well as potential future concerns such as climate change impacts (Sequiera et al. 2014), should be closely monitored.","The Whale Shark has been listed in a number of international conventions and agreements. The species is included in Annex I (Highly Migratory Species) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides a framework for the conservation and management of fisheries, and other uses of the seas. To date, no management initiatives enacted through UNCLOS have included the Whale Shark. Under the aegis of this convention, the United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks was introduced in 1995, which has potential for direct actions to be taken in relation to species such as Whale Shark, although none have yet been proposed (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Also in 1995, the FAO finalized a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and then in 1998 the International Plan of Action for Conservation and Management of Sharks (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Davidson et al. (2015) noted that only 22 National Plans Of Action had been published at that time, limiting the effectiveness of this initiative.The Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) in 1999. This identifies it as a migratory species whose unfavourable conservation status would benefit from the implementation of international cooperative agreements. The CMS has provided a forum for the development of more direct conservation approaches with the adoption, in 2010, of a Memorandum of Understanding on the migratory shark species listed on this agreement, including Whale Shark. There were 40 signatories to this memorandum as of February 2016, which aims to improve scientific knowledge, ensure fisheries sustainability, protect critical habitats, movement corridors and life stages of sharks, while increasing public participation and national, regional and international cooperation towards these objectives. Whale Shark routinely move across political boundaries (summarised in Rowat and Brooks 2012), emphasising the importance of this unified approach.Whale Shark was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 2002. This requires fishing states to demonstrate that any exports were derived from a sustainably managed population, enabling exports and imports to be monitored through a permit system. Continued presence of Whale Shark fins in Hong Kong markets, a major international transit point, despite no records in the CITES Wildlife Trade Database (http://trade.cites.org) suggests that illegal trade is occurring outside the CITES permit system. No Whale Shark fisheries have been certified as sustainable under CITES Appendix II regulations. Identifying the source of these fins, and enforcing CITES regulations, should be a key goal for managers.National- or territory-level management measures for Whale Shark, via shark fishing bans or specific species protection, are in place in American Samoa, Australia, Bahamas, Belize, Cambodia, Chagos Archipelago (UK), China, Congo-Brazzaville, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, French Polynesia, Guatemala, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Honduras, Indonesia, India, Kuwait, Maldives, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Myanmar, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, Philippines, Qatar, Reunion, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, St Helena Island (UK), Taiwan, Thailand, Tokelau, United Arab Emirates and USA. Species-level legislative protection is an important conservation goal in countries where Whale Shark are still caught, either as a target or bycatch, including China, Mozambique, Oman, Pakistan and Tanzania.While many of the larger commercial fisheries for Whale Sharks have now ceased, primarily due to rapid catch reductions, fishery and trade management is still required. The active fishery in Chinese waters is almost certainly unsustainable (Li et al. 2012). This national fishery is likely to be the largest single direct threat to Whale Shark recovery in the Indo-Pacific. Enforcement of existing laws for Whale Shark protection, and education and awareness programmes for fishers, will be an important component of management there.Key habitats for Whale Sharks, in the form of coastal feeding locations or movement corridors, are protected in Australia (Ningaloo Reef), Belize (Gladden Spit), Costa Rica (Cocos Island), Ecuador (Galapagos Islands), Mexico (Yum-Balam Biosphere Reserve), Panama (Coiba Island) and the UK (St Helena Island). Site protection is necessary in some areas where high densities of Whale Sharks are present, as anthropogenic pressures on these sites could have disproportionate impact on subpopulation declines. Important aggregation areas for Whale Sharks in Mexico (de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011), Mozambique (Haskell et al. 2015) and Qatar (Robinson et al. 2013) are examples. Where Whale Sharks are routinely feeding on the surface, such as off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Motta et al. 2010, de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011), these areas should also be managed to reduce vessel strikes in nearby shipping lanes. This could entail either seasonal ‘go-slow zones’, or moving these routes to avoid the shark aggregations. Protection of the specific biological phenomena that influence Whale Shark presence at many aggregation sites, such as fish spawning events (Heyman et al. 2001, de la Parra Venegas et al. 2011, Robinson et al. 2013), would also help to safeguard these habitats.Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) have banned the intentional setting of purse-seine nets around Whale Shark in the Eastern Pacific, Western Central Pacific (WCP) and Indian Oceans, though not yet in the Atlantic Ocean (Capietto et al. 2014). However, a large proportion of entangled Whale Sharks (73% in WCP; SPC-OFP 2012) were not sighted prior to nets being deployed. Therefore, fisher education and regulation on safe release practices should be a key management goal. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and Indian Ocean Tuna Commission require that best practices for safe release of Whale Sharks be followed when they are accidentally encircled (Capietto et al. 2014), and similar guidelines were endorsed by Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission members in 2015. All RFMOs should prohibit the deliberate setting of nets around Whale Sharks, and require that Whale Sharks be safely released when they are caught accidentally (i.e., using updated recommendations following Poisson et al. (2014) and the summary of guidelines by Clarke 2015). Fisher education and training initiatives would be useful to facilitate implementation.Whale Shark tourism is managed through legislation in Australia, Belize, Ecuador, Mexico and St Helena Island (UK). At the time of writing, whale shark tourism was not legal in Qatar, where whale shark aggregations occur in a restricted oil field (Robinson et al. 2013). Voluntary codes of conduct exist in many other tourism locations. As tourism can increase the risk of boat strikes, due to the close proximity of boats and sharks, enforcing minimum approach distances for vessels can help to reduce shark stress (Pierce et al. 2010) and reduce the probability of boat strike. Similarly, enforcing general codes of practice for tourism industries will help to ensure their sustainability.In some areas, such as China, India, Mozambique, Taiwan and Tanzania, the close proximity of whale shark feeding areas or movement corridors with net fisheries leads to regular incidental bycatch. Restrictions on mesh size, net length and fishing locations can help to avoid whale shark catch. Training in safe release, or provision of bycatch reduction technologies (deliberate weak points in nets or other ways to avoid entanglement) could help to reduce the likelihood of shark injury or mortality when interactions occur.","Whale Sharks are subject to large- and small-scale bycatch in fisheries, with some national and international trade in products. They are also a focal species for marine tourism industries.The only known targeted fishery for Whale Sharks to have existed in the Atlantic Ocean was located in Santa Cruz, Cuba, where 8–9 sharks were caught each year until the fishery was banned in 1991 (Graham 2007). Aside from Venezuela, where Whale Sharks were occasionally harpooned by fishers (Romero et al. 2000), there are few other records of utilization or trade of individuals from this subpopulation.Prior to 1985, there was little demand for Whale Shark meat in Taiwan, with specimens of several tonnes weight selling at between USD 200–300 (Chen and Phipps 2002). No dedicated fishery was present, though Whale Sharks were caught as bycatch in set-net fisheries (Chen et al. 1997). A meat fishery developed during the 1990s, with annual catches estimated to be 272 individuals in 1996 from set-net and harpoon catches (Chen et al. 1997). Total catches were likely to be higher (Chen et al. 1997). Whale Shark became the most expensive shark meat available in Taiwan by 1997, reaching prices of USD 13.93/kg (Chen et al. 1997). A small 2 t Whale Shark could fetch USD 14,000, with a larger 10 t shark selling for around USD 70,000 in 1997 (Chen et al. 1997). Catches declined after this peak, potentially due to local stock depletion, to 80–100 sharks through the country each year after 1997 (Hsu et al. 2012). However, the annual volume of Whale Shark meat traded more than doubled between 1998 and 2000, to 60 t in 2000 (Chen and Phipps 2002). Market surveys in 2001 indicated that catch was under-reported in official statistics, and that significant quantities of meat were likely being imported through unofficial channels (Chen and Phipps 2002). Following the introduction of specific export codes for Whale Shark meat in 2001, 2 tonnes of exports (to Spain, valued at USD 1.15/kg) and no imports were recorded over the following year (Chen and Phipps 2002). A total of 693 sharks were caught in Taiwan between 2001 and 2008 (Hsu et al. 2012). Total allowable catch quotas steadily reduced through to zero sharks from 2001 to 2007 (Hsu et al. 2012). A small international trade in live Whale Shark was also noted in Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002), and is also present in mainland China (Li et al. 2012).Prior to the protection of Whale Shark in India (2001) and the Philippines (1998), Whale Shark meat was exported from those countries to Taiwan (Chen and Phipps 2002). From 1990 to 1997, 624–627 Whale Shark were caught from four of the primary fishing sites in the Philippines (Alava et al. 2002). Whale Shark meat from mainland China was also thought to be illegally exported to the Taiwanese market (Chen and Phipps 2002). While Whale Shark is not presently targeted off mainland China, there is a large bycatch, estimated to be more than 1,000 individuals per annum (Li et al. 2012). Whale Shark is considered a high value catch in this fishery, so they may be actively targeted in the future (Li et al. 2012). Although the species is technically protected, catches are unmonitored and enforcement is minimal (Li et al. 2012). A reduction in the mean size of landings has been reported, from 8.27 m prior to 2004 to 5.5 m from 2004–2007 and 6.3 m from 2008–2011 (Li et al. 2012). It is unclear whether this apparent decrease in mean catch length reflects a decrease in landings of large sharks.In the 1990s, Whale Shark fins were regarded as low value due to poor quality and the difficulty of preparation (Chen and Phipps 2002). Demand for fins within trade was minimal, although they were sometimes sold as display or trophy fins for shark-fin soup restaurants (Chen and Phipps 2002). More recent surveys have reported that Whale Shark fins are now demanding high prices, which is likely to result in increased targeting (Li et al. 2012). Whale Shark fins are sporadically seen in Hong Kong markets (G. Curtis, pers. comm.), indicating that international trade in Whale Shark fins is still likely to be occurring. The source of these fins is unknown. A live shark was seen with a recently removed first dorsal fin in the Maldives (Riley et al. 2009). Whale Shark were also opportunistically finned in Indonesia in the 2000s (White and Cavanagh 2007).The Whale Shark fishery in India was reviewed by Akhilesh et al. (2013). A traditional small-scale seasonal harpoon fishery in India took Whale Shark for their liver oil, which was used to waterproof boats. In the mid 1990s, fishery effort increased along the Gujarat coast to meet demand for oil, meat and fins from countries in Europe and Southeast Asia. From 1990 until 2001, when Whale Shark became legally protected in territorial waters, there was a targeted commercial fishery in Gujarat. Between 1889 and 1998, 1,974 sharks were recorded as landed through India. Some bycatch still occurs following the closure of this fishery, with 79 landings from 2001 to 2011 (Akhilesh et al. 2013).A small opportunistic fishery is active in Oman (D. Robinson, pers. comm). Small-scale harpoon and entanglement fisheries for Whale Sharks have taken place in several other countries such as Iran and Pakistan (Rowat and Brooks 2012). Recent landings in these areas are unknown. Fishers in the Maldives used to take 20–30 individuals per year for their oil, but reported declining catches during the 1980s to early 1990s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993), and the fishery was banned in 1995. Occasional hunting may have continued following protection (Riley et al. 2009).Tourism industries based on viewing Whale Shark have now developed in several countries or locations, including Australia, Belize, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Honduras, Indonesia, the Maldives, Mexico, Mozambique, Oman, Panama, the Philippines, St Helena, Saudi Arabia, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Thailand. These range in size between a maximum of 24 tourists at a time in Cuba (Graham 2007), to over 250 licensed tour operators off Quintana Roo in Mexico (Ziegler et al. 2012). Direct expenditure for Whale Shark-focused tourism at South Ari Atoll in the Maldives was estimated at USD 9.4 million in 2013 (Cagua et al. 2014), while payments for tours alone off Quintana Roo in Mexico were estimated to be USD 7 million in 2013 (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm). In Western Australia, whale shark tourists spent an estimated AUUSD 6 million in the Ningaloo region in 2006 (Catlin and Jones 2010). Tourist numbers have since doubled, from approximately 10,000 to 20,000 per year, so expenditure will also have substantially increased (B. Norman, unpubl. data). Graham (2007) projected that, globally, Whale Shark tourism was likely to be worth over USD 42 million annually. Rapid increases in the numbers of tour participants in some key locations, such as in Mexico (R. de la Parra Venegas, pers. comm.), Australia (D. Robb, pers. comm.) and the Philippines (Araujo et al. 2014) indicate that the industry is growing fast in economic importance."

It inhabits continental shelves from inshore to a depth of 200 m and is a highly productive species that breeds annually and matures early. The species is taken as target and bycatch by industrial and small-scale fisheries with multiple gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline and is retained for the meat and fins; it is one of the most commonly consumed tropical and sub-tropical coastal sharks globally. The population is reported to have increased in northwest Australia over three generation lengths (15 years), and to be both stable over two years and have declined by 99% over the past three generation lengths (15–22 years) in two areas of India, respectively. It is inferred to have declined by 67–80% in Sri Lanka over the past three generation lengths and inferred to have declined in Southeast Asia. In some other parts of its range, the Milk Shark is reported to have undergone a population increase, possibly due to meso-predator release. The species' productivity likely provides some resilience to fishing pressure, however, the lower productivity where it is heavily exploited in West Africa is of concern. It is heavily fished throughout its range (except in Australia) in mostly unregulated fisheries, and steep declines over the past three generation lengths have been reported. It is suspected that the Milk Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15–22 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Milk Shark occurs across the Indo-Pacific from South Africa to Australia, and in the Eastern Atlantic from Madeira and Mauritania to Angola; there are two records of this species in the Mediterranean Sea (Ebert et al. 2013, Amor et al. 2016).","Genetic data suggest that the Milk Shark is a complex of four species that require further taxonomic investigation (Naylor et al. 2012). Species-specific population trend data of standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was available from northwest Australia (Braccini et al. 2019). The fishery-independent survey with droplines and longlines from 2002 to 2017 found the CPUE to be fluctuating but stable. The area of the surveys was closed to commercial fishing from 1993 to 2005 onwards and the stable pattern is suggested to reflect either no major detrimental fishing effects on the population even prior to the closures or naturally low abundance that precludes detecting abundance patterns (Braccini et al. 2019). The CPUE was analysed over three generation lengths (15 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yielded a 3.8% annual rate of increase, consistent with an estimated median increase of 69.3% over three generation lengths (15 years), and the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information). A stock assessment of this species based on landings during 2012–2014 in Gujarat, India showed that the fisheries exploitation level between 2012–2014 reduced stock biomass and spawning stock biomass to 55% and 34% of unexploited levels, respectively (Sen et al. 2017). The catch-per-unit-effort from 2012 to 2014 was stable and the assessment considered the population to be underexploited (Sen et al. 2017). This assessment should be regarded with caution due to limited time-frame of sampling and some simplistic assumptions. Market surveys from the same region indicate that all life stages of Milk Shark are vulnerable to capture by fisheries (Barnes et al. 2018).Elsewhere in India, data from Mumbai indicatedeclines in landings of this species from 92.9 t in 2000 to 18.5 t in 2005 (Raje et al. 2016). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In India, there is evidence of increasing fishing effort and decreasing catch-per-unit-effort of sharks in general (K. V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 09/02/2017). When this decline is scaled to three generation lengths (15–22 years) it represents a decline of 99%. In Sri Lanka, shark catches have decreased by 30% between 1994 and 1999 from 13,000 t to 9,000 t and have been steadily declining since 2001 despite increasing fishing effort (Dissanayake 2005). This represents a decline of 67–80% when scaled to three generation lengths of the Milk Shark (15–22 years). In Kuwait, this species represented 12.2% of elasmobranch landings by number in 2008 but this declined to 2.6% in 2011 (Mooreet al.2012). In the Iranian waters of the Arabian/Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, the Milk Shark has declined in abundance by more than 85% over the past 10–20 years; some of this decline may be due to an increase in illegal fishing despite a ban on target shark fisheries in Iran introduced ~15 years ago (T. Valinassab pers. comm. 03/06/2020). In Pakistan, landings of the Milk Shark have declined by 75–80% over the past 20 years due to overfishing (M. Khan pers. comm. 03/06/2020). <a name='_Hlk31633737'>In Southeast Asia, catches of sharks and rays are very high but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaberet al.2009). Trawl and gill net fisheries are also moving further afield. For example, in Jakarta the gillnet fishery at Muara Baru travels to waters around Kalimantan due to the decline in local populations (W.T. White pers comm. 22/05/2007). While species-specific data on long-term declines in elasmobranchs in the Southeast Asian region are lacking, declines of the Milk Shark in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific are inferred given the widespread historical and continuing declines of demersal fisheries in this region (Stobutzkiet al. 2006).</a><a name='_Hlk31633737'></a>Across its range, the population was reported to be increasing in northwest Australia over three generation lengths (15 years), stable over two years in Gujarat, India and to have declined by 99% across three generation lengths (15–22 years) in Mumbai, India. It is inferred to have declined by 67–80% in Sri Lanka and inferred to have declined in Southeast Asia. In some other parts of its range, increases in abundance of the Milk Shark have been reported, possibly due to meso-predator release. The Milk Shark is a productive species which likely increases its resilience to fishing pressure, although the lower productivity in West Africa is of concern as it is heavily exploited in that region. With the exception of Australia, the Milk Shark is exposed to increasing and intense fishing pressure across its range, with steep declines reported in some areas. Overall, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generation lengths (15–22 years).",decreasing,"The Milk Shark occurs on the continental shelf in tropical and sub-tropical waters from close inshore to depths of 200 m (Weigmann 2016). It is found throughout the water column but is mainly near the sea floor and is often occurs off sandy beaches and sometimes in estuaries (White et al. 2006, Ebert et al. 2013). The species is usually &lt;110 cm total length (TL), although one specimen of 178 cm TL was recorded off Africa (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Life history traits vary regionally with males mature at 54–82 cm TL and females mature at 62–92 cm (Harry et al. 2010, Moore et al. 2012, Ba et al. 2013, Ebert et al. 2013). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–8, an annual reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 25–45 cm TL (Harry et al. 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Shaaban et al. 2018). In northeast Australia, female age-at-maturity is two years and maximum age is eight years, resulting in a generation length of five years (Harry et al. 2010). In Senegal, female age-at-maturity is 5.8 years and maximum age is nine years, resulting in a generation length of 7.4 years (Ba et al. 2015).","The Milk Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, trawl, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Last and Stevens 2009, Fields et al. 2018). Commercial at-vessel-mortality (AVM) has only been reported for this species in trawl fisheries where it is highly variable ranging from 29–82% in the Indian Ocean and North Australia, respectively (Ellis et al. 2017).  In the Eastern Atlantic, this species is heavily fished throughout its range and frequently caught in Cape Verde, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, and Guinea (Diop and Dossa 2011). It is the most commonly caught shark landed at fishing sites along the Senegalese coast (Capape et al. 2006, Ba et al. 2015). The predominance of juvenile Milk Shark in landings during all seasons could be an indication that the species is overexploited in Senegalese waters (Ba et al. 2013). It is among the most commonly caught shark by artisanal fisheries in the waters of Mauritania (Valadou et al. 2006). In the Banc d’Arguin National Park (Mauritania) 70–85% of individuals caught from April to June are females, more than half of which are pregnant with fully-developed embryos (Diop and Dossa 2011); this suggests that fishers target a pupping aggregation in this region. Declines in coastal shark assemblages have been reported throughout the eastern Atlantic region, although recreational fishers in the Bijagos Archipelago (Guinea-Bissau) have noticed an increased abundance of Milk Shark that has been attributed to declines in the numbers of large, predatory sharks (Diop and Dossa 2011).  In South African waters, the Milk Shark is caught incidentally by prawn trawl fisheries. The estimated annual catch of the Milk Shark in trawl fisheries of South Africa was &lt;1 tonne for 2010–2012 (da Silva et al. 2015). The species is also important to recreational fisheries and was the second most commonly caught shark (18% of total catch) in the Kwa-Zulu Natal competitive shore fishery from 1977 to 2000 (Pradervand 2007). Van der Elst (1979) hypothesized that an increase in abundance of small sharks, including the Milk Shark, in the Kwa-Zulu Natal recreational fishery was due to the removal of large, predatory sharks by the Natal Sharks Board protective gillnet program.Extensive artisanal fisheries operate in coastal waters of the southwestern Indian Ocean (Le Manach et al. 2012, Benkenstein 2013, Cripps et al. 2015). It is an important component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in mainland Tanzania andZanzibar where it has been recorded as the most abundant in market surveys (Fowler et al. 2002, Schaeffer 2004). The species is also an important component of artisanal shark fisheries in Madagascar waters (Robinson and Sauer 2013).    In the Arabian Seas region, surveys of fish markets and landings sites have revealed this speciesto be a major part of elasmobranch landings, often as bycatch in gillnet fisheries (Henderson et al. 2007, Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, Jabado et al. 2015, Spaet and Berumen 2015). The high level of exploitation on its habitat in the region is of concern.For example,in Eritreacatch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehayeet al.2007). <a name='_Hlk31633737'>While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licenses issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is widespread and impacting shark populations (Glaser et al. 2015).In Iran, there is increasing fishing effort with the number of fishermen almost doubling from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601 in 2002 (Valinassabet al.2006). In some areas (e.g. Pakistan, </a><a name='_Hlk31633737'>India</a><a name='_Hlk31633737'>) fishing effort on this species has been increasing in recent years. </a><a name='_Hlk31633737'>In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in outer shelf waters (M.

Trawling is also intense in Kerala where CMFRI (2010) reported 3,678 trawlers. There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheenet al.2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). In India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010).</a> <a name='_Hlk31633737'> </a> <a name='_Hlk31633737'>In Southeast Asia, the Milk Shark is one of the most commonly caught sharks in trawl fisheries of peninsular Malaysia and is commonly caught in gillnet fisheries of Indonesia (Department of Fisheries Malaysia 2006, White et al. 2006). The extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are also a threat to coastal and inshore species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro et al. 2010).</a><a name='_Hlk31633737'> </a>       In Australia, the Milk Shark is a bycatch in gillnet and prawn trawl fisheries with low to moderate fishing pressure in managed fisheries. It is usually not retained but post-release mortality is likely high (Stobutzki et al. 2002, Tobin et al. 2010). Northwest Australia was closed to commercial fishing of sharks and rays from 1993 to 2005 onwards to protect breeding stocks of Dusky Shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and Sandbar Shark (C. plumbeus) (Braccini et al. 2019). Ecological risk assessments of the Milk Shark have considered it to be at low to moderate risk from fishing in Australia (Stobutzki et al. 2002, Zhou and Griffiths 2008, Tobin et al. 2010).","There are few species-specific regulations for the Milk Shark. In South Africa, for small-scale fishing there is a bag limit of one individual Milk Shark for consumption only (DAFF 2016). In Iran, a ban on target shark fisheries introduced ~15 years ago (T. Valinassab pers. comm. 03/06/2020) may benefit the Milk Shark. The introduction of bycatch reduction devices in Australian trawl fisheries is likely to have benefited this species (Griffiths et al. 2006), as would have Australia's extensive network of Marine Protected Areas. Research is needed on the species' taxonomy and population size and trends, and catch rates should be monitored.","The Milk Shark is one of themost consumed sharks in tropical and subtropical coastal waters globally. The flesh is consumed fresh or dried, salted, and smoked and used as fishmeal (Last and Stevens 2009, Roy 2010). Fins are of limited value due to their small size although trade in small, low-value fins has increased in Southeast Asia in recent years (Cardeñosa et al. 2019). Milk Shark fins comprised 1.4% of the fins sampled in Hong Kong in 2015 yet were the most common of the small-sized shark fins sampled in Hong Kong in 2019 (Fields et al. 2018, Cardeñosa et al. 2019)."

Species-specific landings are not reported though it is included in mixed landings of species of Sardinella and is a component of commercial fisheries in parts of its range. It is likely also taken in artisanal and subsistence fisheries throughout its range, though fishing pressure is not considered a major threat at this time. This species is reported to be taken as by-catch in shrimp trawl fisheries (e.g., Kuwait and Australia), though this is a localised threat and has been assessed as low risk in Australia. Illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing is thought to negatively impact this species, though the extent is not known. There are no species-specific conservation measures in place, though its geographic distribution may overlap with existing marine protected areas and seasonal fishing closures have been implemented in parts of its range (e.g., the Philippines). Furthermore, is sardines have been shown to experience improved reproduction during periods of El Niño.

Monitoring of the harvest levels and extent of harvest is recommended.","Sardinella albella occurs in the Indo-West Pacific from the east coast of Africa and Madagascar, north to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, east throughout the Gulf of Thailand, off Taiwan, south to the Philippines, and Indonesia, throughout the Arafura Sea, off Papua New Guinea, and northern Australia (Whitehead 1985, Paxton et al. 1989, Russell and Houston 1989). In the Philippines, this species is known from Caraga, Layte Gulf ( Eastern Visayas), Bicol, Honda Bay (Palawan), and the Zambales coast (West Philippine Sea: BFAR NSAP 2015). According to a recent study, no true S. albella were found east of the Bay of Bengal, and therefore may represent an incorrect biogeographic distribution based on misidentifications (Stern et al. 2016). This species has likely been confused with S. fimbriata (Stern et al. 2016). This species has an estimated depth range within 0-50 m.","This species is presumably abundant and common throughout its range. For example, this species is 'thriving' in Philippine waters (Samonte et al. 2000) and was ranked the sixth among the ten most dominant species caught in the sampling trawl in Kuwait Bay during the spring of 2004 (Chen et al. 2009). In the western side of the Straits of Hormoz, this species is more abundant, and is fished by both the United Arab Emirates and Iran. This species may be more common in Iraqi waters than Sardinella gibbosa (Mustafa Al-Mukhtar pers comm. 2014). However, it may be less abundant in the northwest Persian Gulf as only 4 individuals were collected from the Port Station in Khor Al-Zubair from August 1987 to June 1988 (Hussain et al. 1994). Species-specific landings are not reported to the FAO, though it is recorded in mixed catches of species of Sardinella in parts of its range, and is likely to be a component of subsistence and artisanal fisheries throughout its range. Directed fisheries for species of Sardinella are reported to the FAO from Tanzania, Eritrea, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (FAO 2016). In Iran, there were 33,000 tonnes per year of clupeids recorded between 2011-2012, and there is a large fishing area for mixed species of Sardinella near Qeshm Island and a second in the Oman Sea (Jask). Species ofSardinella are also caught in Iraq, but mostly as by-catch with no official statistics. This species is caught as by-catch in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Bahrain, and northern Australia and is likely to be included in by-catch throughout its range. In Saudi Arabia, S. albella is not of major commercial importance, and is probably only a component of by-catch. Landings from Bahrain (2004-2012) are highly fluctuating with no clear trend. In the Philippines, the recorded nominal CPUE for the ring-net fishery was 273.73 kg per boat, per day in 2013 to 138.70 kg per boat, per day in 2016, with a clear decreasing trend (BFAR- NFRDI NSAP 2017). However, it is difficult to interpret this trend in a species that exhibits boom-bust cycles like this.A species of Sardinella that has been misidentified as S. sirm in Iraqi waters, was calculated to have natural mortality of 0.665 and a fishing mortality of 0.349, indicating that this species was likely not over-exploited (Mohamed et al. 2001).

Individuals have also been found in mangrove forests in Queensland, Australia (Robertson and Duke 1990). It is a schooling species considered to be an epi-pelagic planktivore (Freije and Awadh 2008) that feeds on zooplankton and phytoplankton. This is a short-lived species with a maximum known longevity of less that two years (Holt 1960, Sekharan 1968). This species is thought to reach maturity at approximately 10 cm standard length. In the Zanzibar Channel, S. albella reproduces from May to August, with a peak in July/August (Okera 1974).

This species is also a component of artisanal fisheries in parts of its range (e.g., Mozambique: Lopes and Gervasio 1999) and is included as by-catch in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain and probably throughout its range. In northern Australia, Sardinella albella is taken as by-catch in tropical demersal trawls targeting prawn species (Salini et al. 2001). In Iran, there is a large fishing area for mixed species of Sardinella near Qeshm Island and a second in the Oman Sea (Jask), both of which use both beach- and purse-seines. In the Philippines, this species is caught primarily by bag-net, ring-net, and encircling gill-net; small quantities are also taken by multiple hook and line, drift gill-net, fish corral, and stationary lift net. Off western India, it is mainly taken by purse seines, lift-nets, and set-nets (FAO 1999). This species is marketed fresh, dried, dried-salted, and made into fish balls. In the Philippines, it is sold fresh, dried and fermented into fish sauce and fish paste at the market.

There has been considerable confusion as to what rank these subpopulations should be recognized. The current version of the Catalog of Fishes (<span style=''>Eschmeyer et al. 2018) accepts three valid species within this complex: S. sagax (Jenyns 1842), S. melanosticta (Temminck and Schlegel 1846) and S. ocellatus (Pappe 1853). However, the most recent global analyses found no morphological or genetic differentiation between any of the five subpopulations (<span style=''>Parrish et al. 1989, Grant and Leslie 1996). Therefore, for the purposes of this assessment, we are treating S. sagax as a single species with five geographically isolated subpopulations.","Sardinops sagaxhas a wide anti-tropical distribution with five geographically isolated subpopulations. It is a highly commercial species throughout much of its range and supports some of the largest global fisheries. Data from available assessments (spawning stock biomass, survey catch rates, landings data, etc.) show some indication of decline over the past 10 years (3 generation lengths); however, this species naturally exhibits large and drastic fluctuations which can be attributed to long-term, regional climatic and environmental conditions and therefore, it is difficult to infer declines based on the available time series. Although this species abundance is currently at historic lows in some regions (e.g., the U.S.; southern Africa; and Japan), it appears to be moderately exploited and is well managed throughout its global range. Therefore, Sardinops sagax is globally assessed as Least Concern. However, overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during periods of high abundance, which can result in extended periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions in areas which generally have viable fisheries. This risk, identified over decades of research and monitoring of the world's major S. sagax fisheries, is now well recognized by regulators and managed accordingly, though localized caution is warranted in areas with consistently high fishing pressure.","Sardinops sagax exhibits an antitropical distribution with five geographically isolated subpopulations that were given taxonomic names at some time in their history. Based on Whitehead (1985) and Parrish et al. (1989), the distributions of these five subpopulations are as follows. In the eastern Pacific, this species occurs from southeastern Alaska, south to Baja California, including the Gulf of California (sometimes referred to as S. caeruleus or S. sagax caeruleus), and from Peru to Chile including the Galapagos Islands (referred to asS. sagax sensu strictu or S. sagax sagax). In the northwestern Pacific, it occurs from Peter the Great Bay, Russia, south to at least Taiwan; H. Hata (pers. comm. 2018) reports it to be widely distributed throughout Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu, but does not occur off the Ryukyu Islands (sometimes referred to as S. melanostictus or S. sagax melanostictus). In the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific, this species occurs from Shark Bay, Western Australia to the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland and New Zealand (referred to as S. neopilchardus or S. sagax neopilchardus). In the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian, this species occurs from Baia dos Tigres, Angola to Durban, South Africa (referred to asS. ocellatusorS. sagax ocellatus); more recent records report this species from Madagascar (Fricke et al. 2018) and the Macarenes (Fricke 1999).This species occurs in coastal waters to a depth of about 200 m<span style=''> (Munroe 2016).","Landings of Sardinops sagax are reported to the FAO as three nominal species: S. sagax, which represents subpopulations off Australia, and in the eastern Pacific off the western coasts of North and South America; S. ocellatus, which represents the subpopulation off South Africa; and S. melanostictus, which represents the subpopulation off Japan. Globally, combined landings of the three nominal species average just over 6.5 million tonnes annually between 1950 and 2014 with a peak of 25 million tonnes in 1985 (FAO 2016). Catch reconstructions are available for Sardinops sagax (1950 - 2010) which appear to encompass global catches and report lower annual catches, averaging just over 3.7 million tonnes annually, but otherwise track very closely with landings reported to the FAO (Pauly and Zeller 2015).Landings reported to the FAO and reconstructed catches show a sharp increasing trend between 1970 and the mid-1980s followed by peak landings between about 1984 - 1988; a maximum of about 25 million tonnes was reported to the FAO in 1985 (FAO 2016). Following 1988, landings and reconstructed catches declined to quantities similar to historical values (&lt; 5 million tonnes) by the late 1990s, and continued to decline below historical catches until the end of the available time series (2010 for reconstructed catches and 2014 for reported landings: FAO 2016, Pauly and Zeller 2015).According to Parrish et al. (1989), previous theoretical considerations and attempts to find discrete genetic stocks suggest it is unlikely that this species can be subdivided into genetically definable stocks within the individual current systems. However, more recent work has been completed (e.g., Schwartzlose et al. 1999, Miller 2006, Ohshimo et al. 2009, Baldwin et al. 2012, Roux et al. 2013, Demer and Zwolinski 2014, van der Lingen et al. 2015, Izzo et al. 2017) to suggest otherwise; at least two or three stocks are recognized in each current system where this species occurs (Izzo et al. 2017). Subpopulation-specific information Northeast Pacific - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. caeruleus or S. sagax caeruleus) is further subdivided into three units: northern (northern Mexico to southern Alaska), southern (Baja Peninsula to southern California) and Gulf of California (Baldwin et al. 2012, Demer and Zwolinski 2014, Izzo et al. 2017). The northern and southern units appear to move north and south along the coast in synchrony, but spawn in separate localities and seasons (Garcia-marales et al. 2012, Izzo et al. 2017). It is an important commercial fishery for Canada, the U.S. and Mexico (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Current subpopulation information is limited. Previously, the subpopulation collapsed in the 1950s and early 1960s resulting in a large contraction of its geographical range; it was virtually absent from waters north of Point Conception (34°N) until the 1980s. A minor recovery of the subpopulation increased its range as far north as San Francisco (Parrish et al. 1989). A recent trawl survey (2001) indicated that this species was largely concentrated offshore between San Francisco and the Point of Conception (33 and 38°N: Demer et al. 2013). In April of 2011, total biomass of the subpopulation was estimated to be ~ 0.494 million metric tonnes (Demer et al. 2013). Independent surveys conducted by the U.S. and British Columbia have reported a significant decrease in sardine biomass (DFO 2011) and spawning stock biomass since 2006 (Hill et al. 2017). Spawning stock biomass has reached historically low levels in recent years (2014 - 2017: Hill et al. 2017). Total coast wide biomass in has declined by ~57% and ~ 79% between 2006 and 2010 in U.S. and Canadian waters, respectively (DFO 2011). The observed decrease in biomass coincided with unusual ocean conditions which may have affected overall abundance and distribution (DFO 2011), similar to other global subpopulations of this species. Recruitment in U.S. waters has also declined since 2005 - 2006 with the exception of a brief period of modest recruitment in 2009 - 2010; a small increase in recruitment was observed in 2016 but the estimate is highly variable and based off limited data (Hill et al. 2017). The 2001 - 2015 year classes have been among the weakest observed in recent history (Hill et al. 2017). Exploitation rates of this species in U.S. waters have averaged about 11 % since 2005 with peak of 13% in 2013; both the U.S. and total exploitation rates of this species in northern U.S. were less than 1% in 2016 (Hill et al. 2017).Southeast Pacific - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. sagax sensu stricu or S. sagax sagax) is further subdivided into three units: northern (southern Ecuador to central Peru), central (southern Peru to northern Chile), and southern (off Chile: Schartzlose et al. 1999). In this region, this species is a dominant small pelagic resource along with the engraulid, Engraulis ringens (Passuni et al. 2018) where it is known to undergo periods of high and low abundance, similar to other global subpopulations. Landings reported to the FAO (1950 - 2014) from the southeast Pacific are presumably referring to this subpopulation and are driven by landings from Peru and Chile with an average of 1.1 million tonnes (FAO 2016). The trend in reported landings tracks very closely with the global trends in landings of this species and is represented by a sharp increase between 1970 and the early 1980s followed by a peak in 1985 (~6.5 million tonnes) and a sharp decline until 2014, the most recent year available in the time series (936 tonnes: FAO 2016).Northwestern Pacific - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. melanostictus or S. sagax melanostictus) is further subdivided into two units: one which occupies the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, and another which occurs along the Pacific coast (Ohshimo et al. 2009, Izzo et al. 2017). In this region, this species is important to fisheries and has experienced wide fluctuations similar to other global subpopulations (Parrish et al. 1989). Declines in landings were reported in the 1940s and the fishery was greatly reduced in the northern portion of its range (e.g., Honshu and Hokkaido) and was primarily restricted to the western Sea of Japan and East China Sea (Parrish et al. 1989). The contraction of spawning grounds was also observed during this time (Parrish et al. 1989). The subpopulation reportedly recovered in the 1970's and expanded its spawning habitat to encompass grounds around southern Kyushu (Parrish et al. 1989), specifically including Tanegashima Island, Osumi Islands (H. Hata pers. comm. 2018). The population in the NW Pacific has shown a continuous decline from about 1987 - 2003 (Nishida et al. 2005, Nishida et al. 2007). Biomass decreased from ~14 - 19 million tons in the 1980s to less than 1 million tons in the late 1990s; biomass remains at very low levels in the most recent years available (2005: Nishida et al. 2007). Additionally, egg abundance has declined by at least an order of magnitude from the 1980s to the early 2000s; juvenile abundance has also declined since the mid-1990s (Nishida et al. 2005, Nishida et al. 2007).Southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. neopilchardus or S. sagax neopilchardus) is further subdivided into at least four units with some degree of overlap: southwestern coast (off Western Australia), Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf, Bass Strait and Port Phillip Bay (off Victoria and Tasmania), and eastern Australia; additional evidence exists for the subdivision of units off Western Australia and the east coast (Izzo et al. 2017). This species is important to fisheries off Australian and New Zealand waters. Catches have increased since the beginning of the available time series (1975) with some fluctuation (Ward et al. 2014a, Izzo et al. 2017). Catches peaked off Western Australia in the 1990s (Izzo et al. 2017) but have remained at low levels over the last two decades following two mass mortality events which impacted the entire population in the mid - late 1990's (Ward et al. 2001, Whittington et al. 2008). A recent stock assessment off South Australia was conducted and indicated that catch and effort has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 after the establishment of a large fishery in 1991 (Ward et al. 2017); it is possible that the increase in catch is also associated with high abundance years in this region. For example, the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) has increased over the last decade from 30,000 t in 2007 - 2009, to 42,750 t in 2017; total annual catches in South Australian waters have also increased (~30,000 t in 2007 to ~38,000 t in 2016: Ward et al. 2017). Significant catches in Australia have been taken from New South Wales, Victoria and in Commonwealth waters (Wardet al.2014b), though a large majority of catch in this region is taken from South Australia (specifically Spencer Gulf), which represents only a small portion of this species total range (Izzo et al. 2017); there is concern regarding the potential local depletion in the Spencer Gulf (Izzo et al. 2017).The fishery in South Australia (Spencer Gulf) was established in 1991 and is currently the largest fishery by volume in the country (Total Allowable Catch in 2016 was 38,000 t: Izzo et al. 2017). Effort has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging from ~760 to 1100 net-sets per year (Ward et al. 2017). Mean annual CPUE have risen from ~30 t/set-net in 2007 to over 40 t/set-net in 2015 and 2016 (Ward et al. 2017). The estimated spawning stock biomass for 2017 was estimated to be between 236,00 t - 305,000 t and is the largest obtained for the southern stock of sardine in Australian waters; the southern stock is classified as sustainable as the spawning biomass for 2017 exceeds the target reference point of 150,000 t in the harvest strategy for the South Australian Sardine Fishery (SASF: Ward et al. 2017). Southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. ocellatus or S. sagax ocellatus) is further subdivided into at least two units: northern (Namibia) and southern (South Africa); additionally, the southern unit is broken down further into three subunits: east of Agulhas Bank, west of Agulhas Bank, and off KwaZulu-Natal (Miller et al. 2006, Izzo et al. 2017, Okomadu 2017). Limited information is available related to this subpopulation, though it is commercially important and reported to follow similar boom-bust patterns of the other four global subpopulations. This species supports a major fishery in African waters and has largely experienced major fluctuations in catches (Okumadu 2017). Off Namibia, the biomass of this unit crashed in the late 1960's; a slight recovery was observed in the 1990's but various stresses (e.g., heavy fishing pressure and abnormal environmental conditions such as hypoxia and the Benguela El Niño) caused a further decline in biomass and catches (Okumadu 2017). Presently, low sardine biomass can only allow limited fishing activity (Okumadu 2017). Within South Africa, the small pelagic fishery which targets this unit is the largest commercial fishery by volume and the second largest in net value (Okumadu 2017). The South African Sardine purse seine fishery has been concentrated along the western coast since the 1940's (Okumadu 2017). This species has undergone wide fluctuations in abundance since the beginning of industrial-scale fishing (Okumadu 2017). Similar to Namibia, high sardine catches taken in South Africa in the early 1960s were followed by drastic declines (Okumadu 2017); a slow recovery followed after management measures were put in place in the mid - 1980s (Okumadu 2017). A slight increase in biomass and catches between 2001 and 2005 (~ 4 million tonnes) resulted from good recruitment; however poor recruitment in 2004 has led to another substantial decrease in biomass in recent years (~ 250,000 tonnes in 2007 - 2008: Okumadu 2017) and has remained at a low biomass since about 2006 (DAFF 2016). In 2015, the Total Allowable Catch for this species was set below 90,000 t for the first time since 1997 which represents its depleted state in South African waters (DAFF 2016). <span style=''>",unknown,"This is a marine, pelagic and migratory species forming large shoals that may spread over several kilometres (Whitehead 1985). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of sardine stocks associated with changes in population size show a similar pattern in all subpopulations (Parrish et al. 1989, Alheit et al. 2009) and are thought to be closely influenced by prevailing winds, currents and local phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations (Munroe 2016). For example, spawning grounds have been completely abandoned as subpopulations decrease in size, or colonized as the subpopulation size increases, or both (Parrish et al. 1989). Similarly, the diets of all five subpopulations show some variation but are generally similar throughout; this species primarily feeds on zooplankton, mostly small crustaceans (i.e., copepods, ostracods, euphausiids and mysids), but also feeds on mollusc larvae and phytoplankton (i.e., diatoms: Whitehead 1985). Individuals reach maturity between 1 – 2 years of age; it is thought that a majority spawn at age 2 (Whitehead 1985). Spawning changes geographically within and between regions but is generally in the winter and spring months of the geographic region with the period extending into summer months in some regions (e.g., off Australia and New Zealand: Whitehead 1985).  Geographic variations in some biological characteristics have also been observed within and between subpopulations, such as maximum size, longevity and depth, as well as preferred spawning habitat. In general, this species is known to a maximum of 36 cm standard length, but is more commonly found to be about 18 - 25 cm; subpopulations in the eastern Pacific are typically larger than the others (Whitehead 1985). Funamoto (2018) reports the subpopulation in the northwestern Pacific (sometimes referred to as S. melanostictus or S. sagax melanostictus) has a maximum longevity of 7 years; Whitehead (1985) reported the northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. caeruleus or S. sagax caeruleus) has a maximum longevity of about 25 years. This species is known from depths up to 40 – 200 m (Whitehead 1985, Munroe 2016). Available information related to spawning habitat from each geographically separated subpopulation is variable, but suggests that this species uses either inshore (bays and coastal waters) and/or offshore (~ 80 km offshore with depths up to 5,000 m) areas to spawn (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki et al. 2007).   Subpopulation-specific information  The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. caeruleus or S. sagax caeruleus) has the longest estimated maximum longevity (20 – 25 years) and the largest measured maximum standard length (36 cm), but is usually found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation mainly matures within 1 - 2 years and breeds in late winter to early summer months (January – June) with peak spawning in April – May (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation migrates northward during summer months between California and British Columbian waters, and returns southward in autumn and winter months to spawn off the southern California coast (~ 80 km offshore), between the Point of Conception and San Diego (Whitehead 1985), possibly extending to southern Baja, California (Kramer 1970, Parrish et al. 1989). Spawning takes place during the night and individuals produce pelagic eggs (Whitehead 1985).  The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. sagax sensu stricu or S. sagax sagax) is known to a maximum standard length of 30 cm, but is more commonly found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This species can be found down to depths of at least 40 m (Whitehead 1985). It is known to breed twice in one season (at least off Chile), mostly between July – September (Whitehead 1985). The spawning period can extend between February – March, though this is less common (Whitehead 1985). This species forms large schools in the Peru Current (Whitehead 1985). Large southward geographical range shifts of this subpopulation have been observed in association with El Niño event (Parrish et al. 1989). Evidence available from years not affected by El Niño events suggest an abundance of sardines in northern Chile have a seasonal pattern, with peak abundances occurring during the winter spawning season and much lower abundances during summer and fall (Serra and Tsukayama 1988, Parrish et al. 1989).  The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. melanostictus or S. sagax melanostictus) has a maximum known standard length of 32 cm based on an individual collected from the Shimane Prefecture, Japan (H. Hata pers. comm. 2018), but is more commonly found to 15 – 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). Individuals in this region reach maturity at age 2 and breed in winter and spring months from about November to the beginning of May; in the southern portion of the northwestern Pacific range, this species spawns in the earlier months of the spawning period (Whitehead 1985). Peak spawning is thought to take place in February (Oozeki et al. 2007); eggs are most abundant between February and March (Oozeki et al. 2007). Spawning mainly takes place along the Pacific coast of Japan and has been observed inshore in protected bays, in the surface waters of open seas and in offshore waters over bottom depth of up to 5,000 m (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki et al. 2007). This migratory species tends to move northward and inshore in the summer months, returning southward and more offshore in the winter months (Whitehead 1985).  The southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. neopilchardus or S. sagax neopilchardus) has a maximum known standard length of 21.3 cm, but is more commonly found to 18 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation reaches maturity between 8 – 13 cm standard length throughout most of its range; individuals off New Zealand are reported to reach maturity at 12 cm SL or above (Whitehead 1985). It is thought that the subpopulation off Australia breeds throughout its entire geographical range, but at different times (Parrish et al. 1989); in the southern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the spring and summer months (September – February), whereas in the northern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the winter months (June – August: Whitehead 1985). In contrast, off New Zealand spawning is concentrated in the area between the North and South Islands (Parrish et al. 1989). This species forms large school at the surface during the spawning periods and when juveniles leave sheltered bays to join adult schools (i.e., southern New South Wales: Whitehead 1985). The southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. ocellatus or S. sagax ocellatus) is known to maximum standard length of 28 cm, but is more commonly found to 25 cm (Whitehead 1985). This is a highly migratory species (though the northern stock perhaps rarely moves south of the Orange River) that prefers the cooler, coastal waters of the southwestern African shelf (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation primarily spawns between September – April and is known to breed either offshore (January – March) or inshore (September – December: Munroe 2016).","The larger subpopulations of this species seem to naturally undergo drastic population fluctuations due to inter-annual, annual and long-term climactic changes resulting in large range contractions and expansions over time (Whitehead 1985, Parrish et al. 1989, Alheit et al. 2009). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of subpopulations show a similar pattern in each isolated region where this species has been heavily exploited (Parrish et al. 1989, Barange et al. 2009); overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during times of high abundance. Periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions result in fishery collapse in areas which generally have viable fisheries (Parrish et al. 1989). Given this species has an anti-tropical geographical distribution and prefers cooler waters, a global increase in average sea surface temperature (SST) may result in prolonged or permanent range contractions in all isolated regions, though more research is needed to determine the extent this may affect this species.","No known species-specific conservation measures are currently in place globally, though its total distribution overlaps with existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). Regional fishery management initiatives (i.e., yearly monitoring, stock assessments, quotas, limited entry fisheries and seasonal closures) are in place and implemented to a varying degree (Barange et al. 2009) throughout most of it range, especially in Australia (Ward et al. 2017) and the United States (Hill et al. 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018). Off California, fishing moratoriums have been put in place for this species during the 1960s - 1980s (Whitehead 1985), and more recently in 2015 - 2017 (Hill et al. 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018).","In general, this species is one of the most important commercial fishes throughout a large portion of its range. It is caught with purse seine, trawls, gill nets and beach seines. Pilchards are marketed fresh, frozen or canned and used for fish meal and fish oil (Munroe 2016). Historically, the five subpopulations contributed about one-quarter of all clupeoid fishes caught making this the most productive out of all clupeoid genera (more than 8 million tonnes in 1983: Whitehead 1985).   Subpopulation-specific information  The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. caeruleus or S. sagax caeruleus) is fished by Canada, the United States and Mexic<span style=''>o (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Landings declined and a fishing moratorium was put in place in the late 1960s (Whitehead 1985) which was reopened in the 1980s. More recently, catches decreased by approximately 95% (1.8 million mt – 86,000 mt) off the U.S. coast between the years 2006 – 2017 warranting current fishery closures in this region (Hill et al. 2017).  The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. sagax sensu stricu or S. sagax sagax) undergoes large southward geographical range shifts during El Niño years; Ecuadorian and Peruvian fisheries can experience drastic declines as this species migrates out of available fishing zones (Parrish et al. 1989). It is not uncommon for total catch to exceed 1 – 2 million tons annually (Whitehead 1985). A majority of catch (~90%) is utilized for fishmeal for fish oil, ~ 4% is canned and the remaining quantity is marketed fresh or frozen (Whitehead 1985).  The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. melanostictus or S. sagax melanostictus) is one of the most commercially important fishes in Japan with record catches exceeding 4 million tons (Whitehead 1985). Observed catches declined sharply in the 1940s; however catches in this geographical region, as in others, generally show notable fluctuations (Whitehead 1985, Parrish et al. 1989).  Compared to other subpopulations, no globally significant fishery has existed for the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. neopilchardus or S. sagax neopilchardus) off Australia and New Zealand (Whitehead 1985, Parrish et al. 1989). However, based on a recent stock assessment off southern Australia, catch and effort for this species has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 (Ward et al. 2017) to be regionally important. It is commonly used as fishing bait and fodder for aquaculture, and is taken with purse seine nets (Whitehead 1985, D. Gaughanpers. obs.2001).  The southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian subpopulation (sometimes referred to as S. ocellatus or S. sagax ocellatus) is taken commercially by Namibia and South Africa off virtually all western and southern coasts (Whitehead 1985). It is used for bait, aquaculture feed, fishmeal and human consumption (D. Gaughan pers. obs. 2001)."

Several sub-regional stock assessment in the Western Indian Ocean report this species to be heavily overexploited, with some estimates of fishing mortality in the Arabian Gulf between two and four times over the optimum. In India, its current exploitation rate is estimated to be 60% over the optimum. In the Torres Strait, this species biomass has declined at least 40–50% since the 1980s, and has declined at least 40% in eastern Australia. In Queensland, management authorities determined this species to be overfished, and the fishery may be in danger of collapsing.

Worldwide reported landings show a gradual increase from 7,186 tonnes in 1950 to 23,5985 tonnes in 2006 (FAO 2009).The species comprises at least two stocks in the Indo-Pacific separated by the Wallace Line (Suleman and Ovender 2010). Indian OceanCatch estimates for Narrow-barred Spanish Mackerel are highly uncertain. The catches of Spanish Mackerel increased from around 50,000 t the mid-1970s to 100,000 t by the mid-1990s. The current average annual catch is around 112,200 t (for the period 2002 to 2006), with most of the catch obtained taken from the west Indian Ocean area. In recent years, the countries attributed with the highest catches of Spanish Mackerel are Indonesia, Madagascar, Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia. The overall catch in the eastern Indian Ocean is relatively stable, whereas in the western Indian Ocean it peaked in 1988 and has levelled off since then (IOTC 2006).Some localized, sub-regional assessments have been carried out (Ben Meriem et al. 2006, Devaraj et al. 2000, Motlagh and Shojaei 2009), but none at a regional level. In the Persian Gulf, catch increased from 3,939 t in 1997 to 8,149 t in 2003 mostly from gillnets but also handlines, and this species is considered to be heavily overexploited (Motlagh and Shojaei 2009, Shojaei et al. 2007). In Oman, it is estimated that at the current fishing mortality rate of 16% for females and 27% for males, the fishery is overfished with a high chance of recruitment failure in the near future (Govender et al. 2006). Similarly, in the Arabian Sea, the fishing mortality rate greater than four times the optimum, and the resource is heavily exploited (Grandcourt et al. 2005). In South Africa, a recent report indicates that there is no indication of overfishing (Govender 1994). AustraliaSeveral stock assessments have been carried out in eastern Australia (Welch et al. 2002) that indicated the stock was around 40–50% of the unfished biomass. The commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE) of Spanish Mackerel has historically exhibited a stable trend, despite inter annual variability in total catch. Assessments have also been carried out in northern Australia (Buckworth et al. 2001), the Torres Strait (Begg et al. 2006), and in western Australia a number of models were explored, and indicated that this stock may be fully exploited to somewhat overfished (Mackie et al. 2003). In the Torres Strait, there has been an estimated 40% decline in biomass since 1980 (Begg et al. 2006). Based on assessments in 2000 and 2002, it was acknowledged that there was a significant degree of uncertainty in fisheries models because the fisheries for this species in Queensland were projected to collapse (Tobin and Malupusan 2004). IndiaIn 1996, a stock assessment of this species along the western coast of India indicated that present exploitation rate should be reduced by 60%, based on estimated maximum sustainable yield (MSY) (Deveraj et al. 1999). Urgent measures are needed to regulate the trawlers and drift gill nets. Southeast AsiaThere is no information on stock assessments or specific fisheries for this species. In Taiwan, this species is a bycatch species in gillnet and trawling. In the Western Central Pacific, this species is recorded as bycatch in a number of different fisheries. FAO reported landings are increasing, but effort is not known. MediterraneanIn the Mediterranean region, this species represents 2.08% total catch of Egyptian Mediterranean coast and its main food is the anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus (Bakhoum 2007). This species is reported to the FAO in catches from Libya where it is targeted.",decreasing,"This species is pelagic and oceanodromous. It is distributed from near the edge of the continental shelf to shallow coastal waters, often of low salinity and high turbidity. It is also found in drop-offs, and shallow or gently sloping reef and lagoon waters. It inhabits coastal waters at depths to 200 m (Collette 2001), but is more frequently caught in areas less than 100 m depth. It usually hunts solitarily and often swims in shallow water along coastal slopes. It is known to undertake lengthy long-shore migrations, but permanent resident populations also seem to exist. It is found in small schools. It feeds primarily on small fishes like anchovies, clupeids, carangids, also squid, and penaeid shrimps.Depending on temperature regime, the spawning season may be more or less extended. In Australian waters, each female spawns several times over the season, about two to six days apart, depending on the locality. Spanish Mackerel spawn off the reef slopes and edges, and they form spawning aggregations in specific areas.This species has an age at first maturity of about two years (Devaraj 1981, Grandcourt et al. 2005, Mackie et al. 2003, Claereboudt et al. 2005). In north Queensland, Australia the oldest male was 10 years (127 cm, 19.0 kg), and the oldest female 14 years (155 cm, 35 kg). This species may live up to 15 years (IOTC 2006), 16 years (Grandcourt et al. 2005), and maybe as long as 22 years (Mackie et al. 2003). Generation length is conservatively estimated to be at least 8–9 years, but possibly may be longer.The all-tackle angling record is of a 44.91 kg fish caught off Scottburgh, Natal, South Africa (IGFA 2009).","This is a highly commercial species caught primarily with gillnets, but also caught with purse seines, bamboo stake traps, mid-water trawls, rod and reel and by trolling (Collette 2001). This species is also taken as bycatch in long-line, purse-seine and gill net gear targeting larger scombrids.A lipid-soluble toxin, similar to ciguatoxin has been found in the flesh of specimens caught on the east coast of Queensland, Australia. This species is considered to be under intense fishing pressure in Oman, and urgent management is recommended (Claereboudt et al. 2005).","There are no known species-specific conservation measures for this species, except in Australia where there are minimum size and bag limits. The Queensland Fishery is regulated under Queensland's Fisheries Regulations 1995. Regulations include a minimal size limit of 75 cm, that applies to both commercial and recreational fishers on the East Coast of Queensland. Recreational fishers are also limited to 30 school mackerel per fishing trip. These licenses also regulate fishing practices and gear.Effort data is needed to interpret national and regional catch landings. This species likely comprises a number of stocks throughout its range, and conservation measures may be better implemented by national agencies, rather than regional management organizations.",This is a highly commercial species in many fisheries throughout its range.

Smith-Vaniz pers. comm. 2013).Maximum size is to 27 cm standard length (SL); it is common to ~24 cm fork length (FL) (Smith-Vaniz 2002). The species feeds mostly at night on large planktonic animals; juveniles feed mostly on crustaceans (euphasiids, decapods) and adults are active predators of fish larvae and early juveniles. Its large eyes could be an adaptation to night predation (Roux and Conand 2000).Its spawning season in Hawaii is from April through September or October. Size at maturity is &lt;20 cm SL. Frequency of post-ovulatory follicles indicates that females spawn every three days. Mean batch fecundities are ~92,000 (Clark and Privitera 1995).In Reunion Island, this species has an annual reproductive cycle. Spawning occurs mostly from October to December with the length of one-year old individuals averaging 21.5 cm FL. Few survive longer than one year (Roux and Conand 2000). Sex ratio remained constant month to month and sexual maturity is attained at 21.5 cm FL. Spawning periods are potentially staggered from April to November, with a peak from September to November (Roos et al. 2007). Some studies indicate that the spawning period for this species extends over a period of 6-7 months (between March and September). Its life cycle is rapid and short(Roos et al. 2007).","There are no major threats known for this species. There are some localized declines due to overexploitation (e.g., Jamaica). It is potentially vulnerable to regional overfishing due to net fisheries.

Its edibility is fair to good (Smith-Vaniz FAO ECA Guide in prep). It occurs as bycatch in commercial bottom trawl fisheries off Qatar and is marketed for low value (Ibrahim et al. 1989).The species is sold in fish markets in the Western Atlantic and is a highly rated bait for sailfish (Smith-Vaniz 2002). It is targeted off Grenada for medium-scale commercial fisheries (Baldeo 2011). It is a minor commercial species off Cuba, Jamaica, and in the U.S. Virgin Islands (F. Pina-Amargos, M. Curtis and J. Brown pers. comm. 2012). Global aggregate catch data for S. crumenophthalmus between 1950-2011 shows an increasing trend. In 1950, only 3,000 tonnes were landed. Between 1958-1995, landings ranged from 20,000 to 60,000 tonnes and then increased to a peak of 174,710 tonnes in 2004, followed by a decline to 134,668 tonnes in 2007. Since then, catches have increased to 205,413 in 2011.Aggregate landings in the western central Atlantic show fluctuating trends. The overall catch is dominated by Venezuela, which has been fishing for this species since 1950. The peak in catch was recorded in 1999 at 3,873 mt, followed by a 52% decline the following year at 1,873 mt, another peak was recorded in 2004 at 3,736 mt followed by a steady drop to 1,209 mt in 2006. Catch landings following 2006 show an increasing trend with a 20% decline from 2009 to 2010 (2,365 mt to 1,895 mt). Based on the CECAF south working (2009), which covers Guinea Bissau to Angola, catch landings for Carangidae spp. from 1994-2008 show an increase up to 20000 in 2001 and are stable until 2008, when they drop to 12000 metric tons, but not all countries are reporting (CECAF 2009).Aggregate catch data for carangids nei in the eastern central Atlantic from 1950-2010 indicate an increasing trend with a peak in 1978 at 42,174 tonnes. Catch subsequently declined by 46% (at 22,821 tonnes) in 1980 and further decreased by 37% between 1980-1981. Landings fluctuated between 1981-1999. A second peak was recorded in 1999 at 30,938 tonnes, representing a 27% decrease from the first peak in 1978. Catch has since declined with a 67% decrease recorded in 2004, a period of five years from the last peak in 1999. Catch fluctuated between 2004-2010.

It is an important component of commercial and recreational fisheries in parts of its range. There are some indications of overfishing in the Gulf of Mexico, although the models used for this assessment need to be refined. There may be some localized declines from exploitation, however, it is not considered a major threat to its global population. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern.In the Gulf of Mexico, this pelagic species is widely distributed and common where it usually occurs around reef structure. Its estimated generation length is 6.5 years. It is commercially and recreationally exploited in U.S. waters and valued in the Mexican sport fishery. The most recent stock assessment for the U.S. population was unable to conclude whether it had recovered or was still undergoing overfishing. According to data in the U.S. stock assessment, the estimated total biomass declined by 39% over the past three generation lengths. Under the assumption that this pelagic species has equal proportions of its population spread throughout the Gulf and the area is roughly equal to half in Mexican waters and half in U.S., we assume that its population in the Gulf has experienced at least a 20% decline due to exploitation. The U.S. population is likely to recover given stringent requirements by U.S. law to rebuild overfished stocks via regularly updated fishery management plans and regulation. It is not managed in Mexican waters and landings statistics for sport fisheries are not collected; therefore, its population status is not fully understood. Therefore, it is conservatively listed as Near Threatened A2bd with a recommendation to improve fisheries management, including collection of data in the sport fishery off Mexico, and to continue management plans in U.S. waters.","Seriola dumerili is circumglobally distributed except for the eastern Pacific Ocean.

In the eastern Atlantic it is known from England south to the Mediterranean and along West Africa to South Africa including offshore island groups (Smith-Vaniz 2002). In the Indo-West Pacific it is known along East Africa from Somalia to South Africa, India, the Persian Gulf, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, China, Japan, and the Hawaiian Islands (Smith-Vaniz 1984, Smith-Vaniz 2002).","Seriola dumerili is very common in museum collections (536 lots with a maximum of 17 individuals in one lot) (<a href='http://www.fishnet2.net/'>Fishnet 2</a> Portal, accessed 5 August 2013). It is common off Cuba (F. Pina-Amargos pers. comm. 2012) and occasional to uncommon in Jamaica (M. Curtis pers. comm. 2012).It is occasionally observed near the reefs of Kuwait (Carpenter et al. 1997). U.S. Atlantic Since the 1950s, it has beenan important component of recreational sport fisheries in U.S. waters (Harriset al. 2007). There are no clear landings trend within the past two decades; a low of 149 tonnes was recorded in 1999 followed by a 72% increase to 538 tonnes in 2000. Over the past 10 years, catch has been within the range of 400-700 tonnes. Commercial landings for Greater Amberjack increased from 3 mt in 1962 to 1,013 mt in 1991. This increase in landings may have been due to hook and line fishermen shifting toward this species during the mid 1980s when human consumption of this fish increased. Commercial landings off the Atlantic coast of southeastern USA have declined steadily since 1991 (when region-wide species landings data first became available) to a low of 195 mt in 2003. Similarly, recreational landings have shown a steady decline, albeit with relatively large fluctuations, since a peak in landings in 1987. Despite regulations implemented by SAFMC, recreational and commercial landings continued to decline. 'None'theless, spawning potential ratio (SPR) for this species of the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States was reported to be 84% in 1993 and the stock is currently being managed using an SPR value or 40%, suggesting that the stock is not experiencing overfishing and is not overfished(Harriset al.2007). Itis a component of the bycatch in the commercial snapper-grouper fishery operating off the southeastern coast of the USA, with the majority retained.Spawning stock biomass showed significant declining trends from 1950 to the late 1990s from over 10,000 mt to about 1,000 mt, a roughly 90% decline. Spawning stock biomass increased from the late 1990s through about 2003, then decreased through 2006. Fishing mortality has decreased since the mid-1990s. The population trend over the last 10-15 years is one of increase (SEDAR 2013). Gulf of Mexico This species was considered to be overfishedwith overfishing occurring in the Gulf of Mexico (Turner et al. 2000). However, there was much uncertainty in the stock status with indices of relative abundance being inconsistent among sectors (SEDAR33 2014). The most recent stock assessment (SEDAR33 2014) was not able to assess a overfished or overfishing status due to conflicting results from different model runs. Predicted annual fishing mortality (F) estimates showed increasing, but low levels of F through the late 1980s. Steady and large increasing trends in F were estimated between the early 1980s and continued through the mid-1990s. Estimated total annual Fs have generally declined since the mid-1990s, with the exception of years between 2003 and 2005, which showed increases in F (SEDAR33 2014).Total biomass and spawning biomass show significant declining trends from the beginning of the time series (1950) lasting through the late 1990s, but then increased through about 2003 (SEDAR33 2014). Since the mid-1980s, average age in the population has experienced moderate increases and decreases; estimated average age declined by 20% since 2010, but no formal conclusion can be made from this trend (SEDAR33 2014). Using an exponential regression of the estimated total biomass for the entire time series (1950-2012) there was a decline of 39% over the past 20 years (1993-2012) (three generation lengths) (SEDAR33 2014; Table 3.2.4.1 pages 109-110). The recent relative stability in total biomass may reflect better management; however, the SEDAR33 stock assessment team was unable to determine whether the stock is actually overfished, suggesting that there still may be concerns surrounding its recovery. In the Gulf of Mexico off Mexico, it is taken as bycatch in a variety of fisheries using longlines and handlines, gillnets, and trolling (SAGARPA 2012). Commercial landings reported to the FAO by Mexico are not species-specific and besides S. dumerili, may also contain catch of S. zonata. Between 1994-2013 (past three generations), these landings fluctuated with no perceivable trend (FAO 2013). It does not support an established directed commercial fishery; however, there is a valuable sportfishery, especially near Alacranes Reef off Yucatan, but no landings records are collected (A. Aguilar Perrera pers. comm. 2015).It is not managed in Mexican waters and landings statistics for sportfisheries are not collected; therefore, its population status is not fully understood. Under the assumption that this pelagic species has equal proportions of its population spread throughout the Gulf and the area is roughly equal to half in Mexican waters and half in U.S. (54% and 46% of coastline, respectively), we assume that its population in the Gulf has experienced at least a 20% decline due to exploitation. There is some evidence for separate population structure within the Gulf, where the northern Gulf population does not appear to mix often with the Florida Keys population (Gold and Richardson 1998, Murie et al. 2011). Connectivity of amberjack populations between the Gulf and the Caribbean is not well understood; however, at least one study found low marine larval connectivity in general between the Caribbean and the Gulf Yucatan region (Cowen et al. 2006). Eastern Central Atlantic Based on the CECAF south working (2009), which covers Guinea Bissau to Angola, landings for Carangidae spp. from 1994-2008 show an increase up to 20000 in 2001 and are stable until 2008, when they drop to 12000 metric tons, but not all countries are reporting (CECAF 2009). Based on ECA country reported landings to FAO for carangids nei landings peaked between 1970 to 1980, averaging around 24,000 metric tonnes per year, and declined in 1980 to an average of 18000 metric tonnes per year, fluctuating between 16,000 and 18000 per year, and has remained relatively stable since. Persian Gulf It is considered highly desirable as a food fish in this region and is valuable where sold in markets especially in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia(Ibrahimet al.1989). It is caught by handline and as bycatch in traps off Abu Dhabi in low numbers. Total landings show an overall decreasing trend over a period of eight years, however, there is some question about the accuracy of these statistics and no stock assessments are available (2005: 28, 15, 19, 31, 1, 0.5, 0.6 mt; 2012:4 mt) (S. Hartmann pers. comm. 2013). This species is part of a group that is directly targeted by handline and gill net off Saudi Arabia where large catches occur regularly. Landings data are available for this group, however, species-specific data are not available (A. Quassi pers. comm. 2013). It is not an important commercial species off Kuwait, Bahrain, and Iran (J. Bishop pers. comm. 2013). Total capture production inAbu Dhabi fisheries has been in decline since 2005. In 2005, 27.5 tonnes were collected, while in 2011, only 0.6 tonnes were harvested.",unknown,"Seriola dumerili is an epibenthic and pelagic species found over reefs or at deep offshore holes or drop-offs, usually in small or moderate-sized schools, but may be solitary(Smith-Vaniz 2002). It is also found over rocky outcrops and wrecks (Harriset al.2007).Juveniles associate with Sargassum or flotsam in oceanic and offshore neritic waters (Bortone et al. 1977).Smaller fish (less than 3 kg) may be taken in shallow water (&lt;10 m). Larger fish usually occur between 18-72 m and have been taken as deep as 360 m.Prey items include fish, invertebrates and sometimes live, dead, and artificial bait. Maximum size is to 188 cm total length (TL), common from about 70 cm fork length (FL) to 110 cm FL (Smith-Vaniz 2002). Pair courtship has been observed in Belize in schools numbering ~120 individuals, primarily following during the full moon and waning moon periods between February and October (Graham and Castellanos 2005). Sexual dimorphism is evident, with females larger than males.The size at 50% maturity is 64.6 cm FL for males, and 73.3 cm FL for females.It is an extremely fecund species, producing 18 to 59 million eggs per individual female in a single spawning season. Peak spawning occurred primarily off Florida and the Florida Keys during April and May. Spawning frequency was estimated as approximately every five days over a spawning season of ~60 days (12 March through 10 May) (Harriset al.2007).Several studies have estimated the maximum age using methods of varying accuracy, and in general, this fish is considered difficult to age (SEDAR9 2011). Estimates of maximum longevity range from 10-17 years, but an age of 15 years was used for this assessment as described in SEDAR33 (2014). This species is assumed to be fully mature by age two (SEDAR33 2014). The Hoenig maximum age natural mortality estimator recommended by the SEDAR33 (2014) is 0.28 year<sup>-1</sup>; however, it is unlikely that this parameter remains constant across all sizes and ages.The generation length was estimated to be 6 years using the equation 1/natural mortality + age of first reproduction. Using the equationage of first reproduction + [z * (length of the reproductive period)] where z = 0.5, generation length was estimated at 7 years. Therefore, the median of 6.5 years was used for the purposes of this assessment.","Seriola dumerili is an important component of commercial and recreational fisheries in parts of its range. There are some indications of overfishing in the Gulf of Mexico, although the models used for this assessment need to be refined. Declines are considered to be on a local basis, and is therefore not a major threat to its global population.","Fishing regulations for this species in U.S. waters were first implemented in 1987 (SEDAR33 2014).Seriola dumeriliis included in the snapper-grouper complex and is managed by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC). The fishery is highly regulated off Florida.Stock assessments for this species are conducted as part of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). A rebuilding plan was established in 2003 under this FMP. The fishery is subject to a 28-inch FL minimum size limit, three fish/person/day bag limit for recreational harvest, 2-day possession limit for charter vessels, 36-inch fork length minimum size limit for commercial harvest, gear restrictions, and an overall total allowable catch limit (SEDAR33 2014).Further research is needed on spawning frequency and fecundity with size and age as well as tagging studies to determine seasonal movements for Gulf of Mexico Greater Amberjack (SEDAR33 2014). Improvements in the management and monitoring of the recreational fishery off Mexico is highly recommended.","Seriola dumerili is collected using pelagic and bottom trawls, hook and line, and traps in many parts of its range; marketed fresh and dried salted(Smith-Vaniz 1984).

In the mid 1990s two charter boats began to specifically targetS. hipposfor catch-and-release sportfishing (A. Bevan pers. comm., Shikari Chaters in Rowland 2009). Charter boats operators subsequently began stopping at theS. hipposaggregations, but in 1998, one operator stopped targeting this species due to concerns over the mortality of released fish. A discussion between charter operators and scientists at the Department of Fisheries Western Australia began soon after (Rowland 2009).Estimates from the National Recreational and Indigenous Fishing Survey, conducted in 2000/01, indicate that annual harvest was 10,890 in Western Australia for a catch described as Kingfish/Samson Fish, with an estimated weight of 98,642 kg. The majority of these fish were likely to be S. hippos,as opposed to the less common S. lalandior S. dumerili,which were also included in this grouping (Kailola et al.1993,Henry and Lyle 2003).The commercial harvest of this species is similar to that estimated for the recreational sector. Commercial catches of this species increased rapidly in the early 1980s and reached a peak of just over 126 t in 1987 with most of the catch taken in the Mid-West and South Coast regions of Western Australia. In 2005, the total commercial harvest for this species in Western Australia was 86.6 t (Department of Fisheries Western Australia unpublished data in Rowland 2009). In 2004/05 this species ranked fifth (50 t) in the top species caught within the West Coast Demersal Scalefish Fishery (Rowland 2009).Off Western Australia, the instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z) was 0.21 year<sup>-1</sup>and the instantaneous rate of natural mortality (M) was 0.40 year<sup>-1</sup>(Rowland 2009).It is rare in New Zealand, which is the southernmost extent of its range (W. Smith-Vaniz pers. comm. 2015).",unknown,"Seriola hippos is a fast swimming predator that inhabits coastal reefs, wrecks and pylons areas or the open sea. Smaller individuals are occasionally found in estuaries (Smith-Vaniz 1999, Rowland 2009) and pelagic sargassum mats are an important habitat for small juveniles. This speciesattains 60 cm TL within the second year of life and reaches a maximum length of173 cm (53 kg) (Smith-Vaniz 1984) with females attaining a larger maximum size than males (May and Maxwell 1986,Rowland 2009). This species lives to at least 29 years. S. hippos is a serial spawner with aspawning period starting in late spring and going into early fall during which many individuals engage in large aggregations. Aggregations have been recorded as being comprised of over 30,000 individuals at a site and covering a circular area of up to 1,875 m².The length at 50% maturity for females is 83.1 cm and about four year of age while all female over 95 cm are mature. Growth is rapid in the first five years for both sexes (Rowland 2009). Off the west and south coasts of Australia, S. hipposundertakes long distance migrations to join spawning aggregation sites near Rottnest Island with some travelling over 2,400 km. This species exhibits strong temporal and spatial spawning site fidelity (Rowland 2009).","This species is heavily fished in some parts of Australia, but significant population declines due to these exploitation events have not been reported and are not suspected. There are no other known major threats to this species.","The minimum legal length of capture for this species off southwest Australia is 60 cm, which is smaller than the length at first maturity (88 cm TL); however, because this species is generally only targeted by sportfishers, there is no urgency to reduce the size limit to match the length at maturity.The maximum daily recreational bag limit of this species was reduced from four to two per fisher.It is recommended that large scale migration and spawning measures be considered to ensure the protection of this species (Rowland 2009). Also, there are numerous marine protected areas in southeastern and southwestern Australia (IUCN and UNEP 2014).","Seriola hipposis a highly regarded sport fish because it reaches a large size and exhibits strong fighting abilities when hooked. It is common in recreational catches on the west and south coats of Western Australia due to its broad distribution and abundance. However, this species has a poor reputation as a food fish(Rowland 2009).This species is often taken as by-catch in demersal fisheries such as Pagrus auratus,Glaucosoma hebraicum, Scombreromorus commerson or tuna (Rowland 2009). In the West Coast Bioregion of Western Australia, this species forms spawning aggregations over shipwrecks in the Rottnest Island Graveyard during the summer which has recently become a world renowned sportfishery (Bain 2007, Rowland 2009). Although this species is not of major commercial interest, it contributed an important portion to the West Coast Demersal Scalefish Fishery (Rowland 2009).The price at market for S. hippos(whole fish) ranges from USD 0.80/kg for gillnet bycatch with lice damage to USD 3.50/kg for premium small line caught fish. Generally, the demand for this species is low and it is not uncommon for catches to be pass in when offered at the Perth Fish Markets. However, when sold, the typical market price is USD 1.50 to USD 2.00/kg for whole fish (P. McKeowen pers. comm. in Rowland 2009). The target market for this species is primarily fish processors who fillet and sell onto supermarkets where is it retailed as low-priced fillets, generally labeled as kingfish. Premium quality fish are also purchased by processors or seafood retailers to be sold as fillets or fish for sashimi (Rowland 2009)."

Feeding habits include selective plankton-feeding (Sano et al. 1984) and the species was observed to be a diurnal carnivore in the Glorieusis Islands, western Indian Ocean (Durville et al. 2003).Juveniles, females and young males have similar colour patterns, but those of larger males are different and often variable (Kuiter 2002). Small juveniles are sometimes found under ledges together with sea urchins, and they tend to form schools at an early age, often staying close to the reef substrate. Adults are often found in large schools of mixed sexes, feeding in midwater on zooplankton. Colourful males are often found separately from these schools (Kuiter 2002).Larvae collected in Palau had a larval duration mean of 72.4 days with a range of 53-90 (Victor 1986).This species has been observed to be a group spawner (Nakazono 1979), at depths of 5-7 m, in channels or passages and around promontory or bommie areas of coral reefs (Collin 7 Bell 1991).

In Marshall Islands, it occurred on most shallow reefs, but not abundant (Colin and Bell 1991). It is also a common reef fish in Solomon Island (Allen 2006), the Barakau Village and Papua New Guinea (Raga 2006) It is the one of the top twentieth most common species of piscivorous fish at Lizard Island (14° 40’ S 145° 28’ E), Australia (Stewart and Beukers 2000). In Kimbe Bay of Papua New Guinea, it was found to be one of the top fifteenth most abundant species with a total abundance of 3231 individuals and a mean density of 1.55 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup> (Srinivasan and Jones 2006). It is also the dominant fish species in Trou aux Biches and Troud’ Eau Douce, Mauritius (Ministry of Agro Industry and Fisheries and Albion Fisheries Research Centre 2004). In Micronesia, it is moderately common in clear water areas of mixed coral, rubble and sand, particularly along upper edges of protected reef slopes (Myers 1991). Large numbers were found in the upper lagoon of the Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve (Kospartov et al. 2006). In Hong Kong, it is rare, only one individual was seen in area of coral at 3 m depth (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). 8 individuals were observed in the Maumere, Indonesia through an underwater visual census survey (Kulbicki undated).",unknown,"This species inhabits coral reefs (Allen 2000), shallow lagoon and seaward reefs, slopes and along drop-offs to depths of one to 15 m (Myers 1991, Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001), but may be found deeper.Bodies of terminal phase individuals have six vertical black bars which are progressively shorter posteriorly, the first black bar passing beneath pectoral fins to abdomen, whilst the last bar is a saddle-liked spot on caudal peduncle (Westneat 2001) and broad pink bands radiating from eye (Sadovy and Cornish 2000, Kuiter 2006). Males and females differ slightly in colour although males are gaudier (Myers 1991). Initial phase is light green in colour with six wedge-shaped, slightly diagonal, dark bars dorsally on body (Sadovy and Cornish 2000).Adults are diurnally active foraging over large (&gt; 1000 m<sup>2</sup>) home ranges (Shima 1999a). It feeds on a variety of preys including fish eggs (eggs of Stegastes ngricans) (Shima and Osenberg 2003), benthic and planktonic crustaceans, small fishes, foraminiferans (Sano et al. 1984) and fish larvae (Dascyllus flavicausus) (Holbrook et al. 2003)The mean duration of the planktonic larval stage was approximately 47 +/-8 days and the maximum recorded duration was 63 days (Victor 1986). It was found to settle on live coral habitat during the early benthic life history (Shima 1999) and settlement occurred during discrete lunar periods (Shima and Osenberg 2003). In Moorea Island, French Polynesia, Dufour et al. (1996) found that settlement occurred over five consecutive nights surrounding new moons between January and June. It was observed to settle at 35 mm in length (1999). It settles directly to patch reefs composed of live coral habitats or algal turf and newly settled individuals remain relatively inactive in algal turf or within branching corals for one to three days while developing juvenile pigmentation patterns (Shima 2001). In addition, juveniles remain site-attached for approximately four to six months (Shima 1999a).Shima (1999, 2001, 2001a) demonstrated that density dependent mortality occurred shortly after settlement to coral communities. And strength of the density dependence mortality was found to be heterogeneous in space and time and was correlated with coral community attributes (Shima 1999, 2001, Shima and Osenberg 2003, Shima et al. 2005). It has been reported to be diandric in Japan (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). During courtship, the terminal phase males had a dark spot on the center of the caudal fin which was absent on the initial phase females. The female ascent rapidly about three to four m when ready to spawn and the terminal phase male swam above her, rapidly fluttering pectoral and caudal fins. Spawning activities were observed in the morning after high tide in May at Marshall Islands (Colin and Bell 1991).Aggregation spawning was documented at Heron Island (Robertson and Choat 1974) and waters adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Russell 2001). However, such behaviour has rarely been study.","There are no major threats known to this species. It is collected for the aquarium trade, but is not heavily targeted. Coral reef loss and habitat destruction may contribute to localized declines in some parts of its range.","There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species. Its distribution overlaps several marine protected areas within its range.While many marine parks have been introduced within the geographic distribution range of this species, for example in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Philippines (Tun et al. 2004), most of these marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered to be poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced due to the lack of expertise, resource and effective co-ordination. For instance, some of the fish sanctuaries in the Philippines are only managed and enforced by the resort management (Tubod fish sanctuary) or local communities (White et al. 2002). As the efficacy of any legislation depends entirely upon its enforcement (Claydon 2004), the majority of these MPAs might not be able to provide sufficient protection (Licuanan and Gomez 2000, Chou et al. 2002).","This species is captured for aquarium trade in the Great Barrier Reef (Ryan and Clarke 2005), Reunion Island (Mulochau and Durville 2005), Taiwan (Shao 2008), Indonesia and Philippines (MAC 2004).

It is one of the most widespread reef fish in the southern hemisphere, found at equatorial regions ranging to 36° S (Ackerman 2004). It was also recorded in Pohnpei (Allen unpublished survey).","This species is common in reefs distributed throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific (Randall 1983). In Australia, it was found to be one of the top fifth most abundant labrids (Fulton et al. 2001). It is found in large abundances along both the west and east coasts of Australia to as far south as Rottnest (32 °S) and Montague Islands (36 °S), respectively (Ackerman 2004). It is also one of the most common fish species in the Great Barrier Reef (Sale and Steel 1989), population abundant in the Lizard Island (Grutter 1995, Stewart and Beukers 2000), with a density of 13 individuals per 150 m<sup>2</sup> (Green 1996) and listed as the top ten most abundant fish species in One tree island (Caley 1995), density of 14 individuals per 200 m<sup>2</sup> (Ackerman 2004), the Great Barrier Reef. It is found throughout both inshore, mid-shelf and outer shelf reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, temperate rocky reef systems and exposed, sheltered and lagoon areas (Ackerman 2004). In addition, schooling has been reported in the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia (Hutchins 2003), density of 30 and 25 individuals per site were found at Palm Islands and Whitsunday Islands, Queensland respectively (Graham et al. 2003). In 2004, Ackerman found this species in the Solomon Islands (15 individuals per 200 m<sup>2</sup>) exhibiting greater density estimates than both Lizard Island and Port Stephens. Whilst at the Outer Reef regions, off Lizard Island and One Tree Island, potentially had the least number of individuals. However, it is worth noting that new recruits were released for other experimental study in Lizard Island (Beukers 1996) and so might cause bias to the density estimation in the underwater visual census surveys. In Kimbe Bay of Papua New Guinea, it was found to be one of the top seventh most abundant species with a total abundance of 6,816 individuals and a mean density of 3.28 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup> (Srinivasan and Jones 2006). On coral reefs of the Adang-ra Wi Islands, The Adaman Sea, mean density was 27 fish per 100 m<sup>2</sup> (Satapoominl undated). In Fiji, a total of 353 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 5-20 cm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008). In New Caledonia, this species is the most common fish species, a total of 10,657 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 3-28 cm TL. In a total of 45 stations, 221 individuals were caught with total body weight of 1.7 kg (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008). In French Polynesia, a total of 23 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 100-200 mm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008). In Tonga, a total of 184 individuals were observed in various UVC surveys with body sizes of 5-20 cm TL (M. Kulbicki pers. comm. 2008). In the Indian Ocean, it is the most abundant fish species in the Reunion Islands (Letourneur 1996). However, the most southern and northern regions (Abrolhos Island with seven individuals per 200 m<sup>2</sup>) exhibited the lowest estimates of density, whilst Ningaloo North exhibited a relatively higher estimates with 11 individuals per 200 m<sup>2</sup>. Approximately 27 individuals per 100 m<sup>2</sup> have been observed in the Okinawan coral reef (Nanami et al. 2005). A mean density of seven individuals per 250 m<sup>2</sup> was found in Eritrean coastal waters, Red Sea (Daw et al. 2001). It was found to be common in the Hong Kong waters (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). On the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, an estimated mean density of 15.5 individuals from twenty 50 m X 5 m transects was recorded in underwater fish visual surveys (Yusuf et al. 2002). In Langkawi Island, Malaysia an estimated mean density of 3.67 individuals from three 100 m X 2 m transects was recorded in underwater fish visual surveys (Lee et al. 2005). In Pangkor Island, Malaysia an estimated mean density of 0.67 individuals from three 100 m X 2 m transects was recorded in underwater fish visual surveys (Y. Yusuf unpublished data).",stable,"This species is diurnally active (Pawlik et al. 1988), and inhabits coral, coastal, rocky and sheltered reefs at depths ranging from one to 30 m (Allen 2000, Westneat 2001). In Hong Kong, it was found in areas of corals, boulders and bedrock along sheltered and highly exposed shores. It was observed singly or in groups (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). It feeds primarily upon small benthic invertebrates and fish eggs (Pawlik et al. 1988, Westneat 2001, Ackerman 2004), Randall et al. (1990) also noted that it occasionally consumes fishes. Juveniles are more abundant in coral areas where they remain close to the substrate, especially branching Acropora corals (Sadovy and Cornish 2000).No enlarged tooth can be found at rear of upper jaw, lateral line bends down below posterior portion of dorsal fin base with 25 pored scales (Westneat 2001). Small fish differs in colour from adults and possess a truncate caudal fin, whilst adults have a distinct lunate caudal fin (Sadovy and Cornish 2000). Adults are bright green to blue with a vertical red band on each scale and most horizontal, red or purple lines on head, while small individuals are olive green on upper part of the body and blue-white ventrally (Westneat 2001).It is reported to be a protogynous hermaphrodite (Robertson and Choat 1974, Ackerman 2004), where individuals change sex from females to males. Males were significantly larger and older than females of the same age. Male growth trajectory appears to continue increasing in size with increasing age, however, the increase in size with age for the females is markedly reduced in comparison. From age of three to five years the increase in size for mature females is relatively small. In the Great Barrier Reef, this species exhibited sex change at age of approximately three years and size of approximately 12 cm SL. Females were found to be mature at the age of one year and size of sevem cm SL, and few mature females were found to be remaining in the population beyond four years of age. The maximum longevity was 12 years (Warner et al. 1975). Cleaning behaviour was reported for this species (Okata 1994).A general pattern of increasing longevity with increasing latitude was demonstrated in both the Indian Ocean and Pacific basins. In addition, it was found that reef exposure appeared to play a significantly role in shaping the life history parameters. Populations inhabiting in sheltered regions exhibited slow initial growth rates compared with those populations in exposed regions. However, the impact of reef exposure on the life histories is unpredictable (Ackerman 2004).This species is not permanently territorial, it sets up temporary territories during spawning season. Pair spawning, involving a single male and female, or aggregate spawning in which one female and a group of males have been observed (Robertson and Choat 1974). In the Great Barrier Reef, spawning aggregations were observed in July and ripe gonads were found in August. Spawning events occur throughout the year at Palm Group Islands, Great Barrier Reef (Ackerman 2004). It uses the exposed habitats as spawning sites and spawn upon a strong current tidal effect, yet resides in more sheltered conditions (Robertson and Choat 1974). It was found that this species may move up to 500 m along a contiguous reef during periods of strong tidal movement for spawning purposes (Ackerman 2004).Duration of planktonic larval stage was found to be 55 days in One Tree Lagoon, Great Barrier Reef (Brothers et al. 1983) and 46.8 +/- 6.3 days in Palau, Western Pacific (Victor 1986). The maximum recorded size of this species is 25-28 cm TL (Randall et al. 1990).At One Tree Lagoon, the Great Barrier Reef, overall mortality during the first year was 29% and average annual mortality 4.9% +/- 1.2 %, it did not show any significant relationship between mortality rates and population of the species (Warner et al. 1975, Eckert 1987).Thalassoma lunare x T. quinquevittatum and Gomphosus species x T. lunare hybrids were observed in the wild (Allen 2006).","There are no major threats known for this species, although it is taken by fish traps, hook and line and monofilament traps and sold for food and is also collected for the aquarium trade.","There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species.

It is also observed in the Cape d’ Aguilar Marine Reserve (Hong Kong) and the Watamu Marine Park (Kenya) which has eliminated fishing for more than 10 years (AFCD 2008) and 20 years (McClanahan et al. 2002), respectively. Spawning aggregation was observed outside the Great Barrier Reef marine park (Russell 2001) and elsewhere have been observed and reported. Furthermore, the Government of Australia is currently revising the proposal of establishing a 400,000 square mile Coral Sea Heritage Park, where fishing would be banned, in the Great Barrier Reef (Underwater Times 2008).While many marine parks/reserves have been introduced within the geographic distribution range of this species, in places like Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Philippines (Tun et al. 2004), most of these marine protected areas (MPAs) are considered to be poorly managed or legislation is poorly enforced due to the lack of expertise, resource and effective co-ordination.

Based on stock-size weighted changes in biomass or spawning stock biomass relative to MSY or other indicators across all stocks, there has been estimated 3–19% decline globally over the past 20–25 years (three generation lengths; approximately 1993/1995–2016/2018). The largest stock decline, of up to 40% over three generation lengths (1993–2015) has occurred in the Mediterranean Sea, and is of concern. Additionally, between 20–40% declines are estimated to have occurred in the Indian Ocean over the past three generation lengths, where overfishing is occurring and which constitutes approximately 10% of the global population. As this species has a circumglobal distribution and a very large global population size, it does not meet any of the thresholds for criteria B, C or D, and criterion E cannot be applied because a quantitative analysis of future extinction probability is not available.However, with more than 90% of its global range in areas where overfishing is not occurring, and the species is not considered overfished, Albacore Tuna qualifies for consideration under criterion A1. Given the estimated 3–19% reduction over the past three generation lengths under criterion A1, this species is listed as Least Concern.","Albacore Tuna are cosmopolitan in tropical and temperate waters of all the oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, but they are not found in surface waters between 10°N and 10°S. In the Atlantic, this species is widely distributed between 60°N and 50°S. Albacore distribution in the western Pacific extends in a broad band between 40°N and 40°S, and continues across to the eastern Pacific where it separates into two branches. The northern branch extends from British Columbia to the tip of Baja California, and the southern branch extends from southern Peru to southern Chile (Collette and Graves 2019).","Albacore Tuna is one of the principal market species of the tuna fisheries worldwide, representing 5% of the total tuna catch in 2015 (ISSF 2017). Small juveniles (50–90 cm FL) are generally taken with surface gear (pole-and-line and trolling) in temperate latitudes. Large adult fish (90–140 cm FL) are predominantly taken with longlines in tropical and subtropical waters, and by longlines and occasionally by troll lines in the Mediterranean Sea. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) worldwide reported landings show a steady increase from 103,676 metric tons (mt) in 1950 to over 200,000 mt in 1971. Catches have generally fluctuated between 200,000 and 250,000 mt since that time (FAO, ISSF 2017, Collette and Graves 2019, Pew 2020).Six major stocks of Albacore are recognized: North and South Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, North and South Pacific, and Indian Ocean. There is substantial genetic evidence supporting the six stocks, and each is managed separately (Davies et al. 2011, Montes et al. 2012, Nikolic et al. 2017a). However, alternate hypotheses of stock structure have been suggested including four genetically homogenous populations (Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans (Albania et al. 2013, Laconcha et al. 2015). Analysis of molecular data is consistent with a lack of migration or gene flow from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Albacore population (Viñas et al. 2004, Nakadate et al. 2005). Genetic heterogeneity has been reported within the Mediterranean even though there are no pronounced oceanographic barriers that might limit gene flow there (Montes et al. 2012, Collette and Graves 2019).Two methods were used to estimate the change in population size in each individual stock over the last three generation lengths, or 20 to 25 years. In the first method ('method 1'), the change is calculated based on the linear percent change in population size over the three generation lengths using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method ('method 2'), the average annual percent change in population size over the time period for which data are available is calculated, and used to estimate the change in population size over the last three generation lengths assuming an exponential decline (North Pacific Ocean: 1994, 1994–2018; South Pacific Ocean: 1960, 1992–2016; Indian Ocean: 1950, 1994–2017; North Atlantic Ocean: 1930, 1995–2019; South Atlantic Ocean: 1956, 1994–2018; Mediterranean: 1980, 1993–2015). In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> or SSB/20%SSB<sub>current</sub>, there has been an estimated 3–19% decline globally over the past 20 to 25 years (three generation lengths). To account for differences in stock size, declines for individual stocks were weighted by their MSY (ISSF 2020a). However, except for the Indian Ocean where overfishing may be occurring, all stocks currently are not overfished, nor experiencing overfishing. North Pacific Ocean North Pacific Albacore support one of the most valuable tuna fisheries in the eastern Pacific. Currently, the main nations fishing in this area are Japan and the United States. Historically, the Japanese fishery has historically harvested the largest percentage (about 72%) while the US fisheries are responsible for most of the remaining harvest. The main fishing gears are longline (39%), and pole-and-line (37%) followed by trolling (22%). Catches by longlining have shown a decreasing trend since 1997 (Collette and Graves 2019). In 2019, catches were about 65,100 t, an increase of 13% from 2018 (ISSF 2020b).Based on SSB/20%SSB<sub>current</sub>, F=0, with 20%SSB<sub>current</sub>, F=0 being the limit reference point adopted by the WCPFC from the base case model (WCPFC 2020), the North Pacific Ocean stock is estimated to have declined by 23% between 1994 and 2018 using method 1, and by 14% over the last three generation lengths, using method 2. Based on MSY, the North Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 40% of the Albacore Tuna's global population. However, the North Pacific stock is likely not overfished nor subject to overfishing (WCPFC 2020, ISSF 2020b). South Pacific Ocean Taiwan, China, and Fiji are the major nations fishing for Albacore in the South Pacific. Albacore catches in this region increased from approximately 40,000 metric tons (mt) in the late 1960s and early 1970s to 80,000 mt by 2009. The catch of 68,600 mt in 2016 is similar to that of 2015 (ISSF 2017). The main fishing gear is longline, which accounts for 96% of the catch (Collette and Graves 2019), however there has been significant drift gillnet catch in the past.Based on median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> (WCPFC 2019b), the South Pacific Ocean stock is estimated to have declined by less than 3% between 1992 and 2016 using method 1, and declined by 23% over the last three generation lengths using method 2. Based on MSY, the South Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 30% of this species global population. However, the South Pacific stock is not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b), but is below its target reference point of 56%SSBF=0. Indian Ocean Currently, Taiwan is the main nation fishing for Albacore in the Indian Ocean. Catches of Albacore in the Indian Ocean gradually increased from 20,000 mt in the early 1990s and have fluctuated between 25,000 and 40,000 mt for the past 30 years. Catches have almost exclusively been made by longline except for a period from 1980 to 1995 when drift gillnets accounted for as much as a third of the catches (Nikolic et al. 2017, Collette and Graves 2019).Based on the stock synthesis for SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> (IOTC 2019), the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to have declined by 33% between 1994 and 2017 using method 1, and 35% over three generation lengths using method 2. However, the based on MSY, the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 10% of this species global population. The Indian Ocean stock is not overfished, but is subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). North Atlantic Ocean The main nations fishing in the North Atlantic are Spain, France, Ireland and Taiwan. Catches of North Atlantic Albacore are primarily made by pole-and-line (35%), trolling (28%), trawlers (17%) and longline (17%). Catches of northern Albacore peaked at 65,000 mt in the mid-1960s, declined to a low of 15,375 mt in 2009, and then climbed back to 30,340 mt in 2016, going to 29,691 mt. Surface fisheries concentrate mainly in the Bay of Biscay and around the Azores and Canary Islands during summer and fall, taking young fish while longline vessels operate throughout the Atlantic year-round and target larger fish (Collette and Graves 2019, ICCAT 2020).Based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the ICCAT (2020) mpb Reference Case model, the North Atlantic stock is estimated to have increased by at least 70% between 1995 and 2019 using method 1, and decreased by 17% using method 2 over the past three generation lengths. However, the based on MSY, the North Atlantic stock is estimated to be approximately 10% of this species global population. The North Atlantic stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (ISSF 2020b, ICCAT 2020). South Atlantic Ocean Currently, the main nations fishing in the South Atlantic are longliners from Taiwan (58%), and pole-and-line vessels from South Africa (17%) and Namibia (6%). Surface fisheries operate mainly between October and May, capturing juvenile and subadult fish. Catches have varied from a high of 41,000 mt in 1987 to a low of about 13,702 mt in 2016, a 10% decrease from 2015. Recently, catches have been increasing, reaching 17,098 mt in 2018 (ISSF 2017, Collette and Graves 2019, ICCAT 2020).Based on the median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the JABBA base case model (ICCAT 2020) for the South Atlantic stock is estimated to have stayed increased about 40% between 1994 and 2018 using method 1, and decreased by 19% over three generation lengths using method 2. However, the based on MSY, the South Atlantic stock is estimated to be less than 8% of this species global population. Further, this stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (ISSF 2020b, ICCAT, 2020). Mediterranean Albacore are caught by a number of Mediterranean fleets, including those of Cyprus, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Malta. Longline is the primary gear, but catches are also made using troll lines, rod and reel, purse-seines and a variety of gears; until 2002, important catches were also made by driftnets and a few fleets reported some gillnet catches until 2010. Reported catches have been increasing, but there is a lack of reporting from some fisheries. Reported Albacore catches in the Mediterranean since 1982 have fluctuated between 1,235 mt in 1983 and 7,898 mt in 2003. In the last 10 years (2009–2018), catches ranged between a minimum of 1,503 mt in 2015 and a maximum of 4,628 mt in 2011, reaching 2,434 mt in 2018. The prohibition to access some important fishing grounds (i.e. Libya) may have negatively biased the fishing data coherence over the last ten years (Collette and Graves 2019, ICCAT 2020).Based on the base case JABBA model for B/B<sub>MSY</sub> (ICCAT 2017), the Mediterranean stock is estimated to have declined by 45% between 1993 and 2015 using method 1, and 40% over three generation lengths using method 2. The fishing area limitations may have affected the latest CPUE series and therefore the results. Based on MSY, the Mediterranean stock is estimated to be less than 2% of this species global population. The Mediterranean stock is not overfished but is near the MSY level, and overfishing is probably not occurring (ISSF 2020b, ICCAT 2020).",decreasing,"Albacore Tuna are a highly migratory, epipelagic and mesopelagic, oceanic species that is abundant in surface waters of 15.6–19.4 °C. Deeper swimming, larger Albacore are found in waters of 13.5–25.2 °C. Temperatures as low as 9.5 °C may be tolerated for short periods. Vertical movement behaviour can differ substantially between tropical and temperate latitudes (Williams et al. 2015). At tropical latitudes, Albacore showed a distinct diel pattern in vertical habitat use, occupying shallower warmer waters above the mixed layer at night, and deeper cooler waters below the mixed layer during the day. In contrast, there is little evidence of a diel pattern of vertical behaviour in Albacore at temperate latitudes, with fish limited to shallow waters above the mixed layer almost all the time. Albacore are known to concentrate along thermal discontinuities. They occasionally form mixed schools with Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and Yellowfin Tuna (T. albacares) in tropical waters.Use of combined Japanese and US tagging data confirm the frequent westward movement of young Albacore and less frequent eastward movements in the North Pacific. This corresponds to Albacore life history where immature fish recruit into surface fisheries in the western and eastern Pacific and before maturing gradually move nearer to their spawning grounds in the central and western Pacific where they are vulnerable to deeper set longline gear (Ichinokawa et al. 2008). Details of migration in the Eastern North Pacific remain unclear, but juvenile fish (2- to 5-year-olds) are believed to move into the eastern Pacific Ocean in the spring and early summer, and return to the western and central Pacific, perhaps annually, in the late fall and winter, where they tend to remain as they mature (Collette and Graves 2019). Mediterranean Albacore is more accessible to fishing gears in spring and autumn, while small catches were noticed in the past in gillnets in early summer. The distribution of albacore juveniles in the Mediterranean is very poorly known.Like other tunas, Albacore feed on a wide variety of fishes, squids, and crustaceans (Iverson 1962, Dragovich 1969, Collette and Graves, 2019). Albacore can reach up to 140 cm FL and 60 kg (Evano and Bourjea 2012). The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) all-tackle game fish record is of an 39.97 kg fish taken off of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands in November 1977 (IGFA 2020). Immature Albacore (&lt;80 cm) generally have a sex ratio of 1:1, but males predominate in catches of mature fish. Spawning occurs in tropical and subtropical waters when sea surface temperatures are 24 °C or higher (Schaefer 2001). Spawning occurs over 7 months, from March to September, in tropical oceanic waters off Taiwan and the Philippines but is reduced to only three months in the Mediterranean, from June to August (Chen et al. 2010, Saber et al. 2015). Like other tunas, Albacore are batch spawners with asynchronous egg development and indeterminate annual fecundity. Fecundity increases with size, but there is no clear correlation between fork length and ovary weight and number of eggs. In the western Indian Ocean, Albacore spawn on the average every 1.7–2.2 days during the spawning season from November to January (Chen et al. 2010, Dhurmeea et al. 2016), in the South Pacific every 1.3 days during peak spawning from October to December (Farley et al. 2013b), but may spawn daily in the Mediterranean (Saber et al. 2015, Collette and Graves 2019). A 20 kg female may produce between two and three million eggs per season, released in at least two batches (Collette 2010).Albacore mature relatively late and at a larger size compared to other tunas. Age of first maturity is estimated to be between two and five years. Estimates of length at 50% maturity are around 90 cm FL in all oceans except the Mediterranean Sea where it is smaller (Wu and Kuo 1993, Ramon and Bailey 1996, Farley et al. 2014, Nikolic et al. 2017a). In the South Pacific, the length at 50% maturity is about 87 cm FL at an estimated age of 4.5 years (Farley et al. 2014) while in the western Indian Ocean the length at 50% maturity for female albacore was 85.3 cm FL (Dhurmeea et al. 2016). Maturity appears to occur earlier for Albacore in the Mediterranean, with a minimum size at first maturity for females of 56 cm FL at an age of 2 years (Saber et al. 2015, Collette and Graves, 2019). Compared to other tunas, Albacore appear to be relatively long-lived. A 128 cm FL fish from the North Pacific was determined to be 15 years, slightly older than estimates obtained from other Albacore age and growth studies (Chen et al. 2012, Farley et al. 2013a, Wells et al. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019). Generation length is not well known for Albacore, but may be 8–10 years (Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, generation length was estimated to be 6–7 years, based on age-structured data from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Collette et al. 2001). For this assessment, a midpoint estimate of 7–8 years has been adopted to represent generation length.","Albacore are mainly marketed as canned white meat tuna, among the most expensive canned tuna. They are caught with six main types of gear: pole-and-line, longline, gillnet, troll, purse-seine, and mid-water trawl (Nikolic et al. 2017a). Longline caught Albacore is mostly used for sashimi and sushi in recent years. The driftnet fishery for Albacore has been banned since 2002 in the EC countries and from 2004 in all the ICCAT Mediterranean countries, but it is known that illegal fishing activity still occurs in some areas (Collette and Graves 2019). The Indian Ocean stock, which accounts for about 11% of the global population based on MSY (ISSF 2020a), is experiencing overfishing.","This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).In the North Atlantic, Albacore were overfished in the early 2000s, but ICCAT adopted a rebuilding plan that reduced TACs for several years, allowing the spawning stock biomass to recover. The stock is now managed with a harvest control rule, including quota allocations for the major harvesters and a landings cap of 215 mt for minor harvesters. In the South Atlantic, the Albacore stock was considered to be overfished in the late 1990s, but stock status has been improving (ISSF 2017). Current management measures include catch limits for major harvesters, with others restricted to catches of no more than 25 mt. In the Mediterranean Sea, management measures adopted by ICCAT include limits on vessel numbers and a two-month closed period for the fishery that coincides with a seasonal closure of the Mediterranean swordfish fishery. In the North Pacific, WCPFC management measures adopted in 2019 calls to not increase effort beyond current levels and to limit vessels fishing for North Pacific Albacore to the 2002–2004 average. In the South Pacific, the WCPFC adopted a management measure to limit vessels fishing for South Pacific Albacore to the number fishing in 2005, or the 2000–2004 average. A plan is under development to rebuild the stock to its target reference point. In the Indian Ocean, no conservation and management measures have been adopted by the IOTC (Collette and Graves 2019). Management procedures are under development for all Albacore stocks, except in the Mediterranean.","An important fishery exists for this species globally, which product is mainly marketed as canned white meat tuna. The global end value of commercial albacore fisheries was USD 2.1 billion in 2018 (Pew 2020)."

It is important in commercial fisheries throughout the world. Based on stock-size weighted changes in total biomass, SSB, B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or CPUE, there has been an estimated 8–17% decline globally over the past 10–14 years (three generation lengths). However, there is uncertainty in this global decline estimate as a static population size over three generation lengths was assumed for the Indian Ocean based on the most recent CPUE timeseries data not exhibiting any clear trends. The Indian Ocean stock, which comprises approximately 28% of this species global population based on MSY, is also overfished and subject to overfishing. However, as global declines over the past three generation lengths are less than 17%, the Yellowfin Tuna is currently listed as Least Concern.","Yellowfin Tuna are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas, but vagrant individuals may appear in various areas (Di Natale, A., pers. comm., February 2021). They primarily occur between 20°N to 20°S, but during summer months they have been caught at latitudes as high as 45–50° in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In the eastern Pacific, they commonly range from southern California and the southwest and central eastern parts of the Gulf of California to Peru, including all the oceanic islands. They may occur off Oregon and Washington during El Niño years (K. Schaefer pers. comm. 2008). During the Austral summer, Yellowfin Tuna have been caught in waters south of the Cape of Good Hope (Talbot and Penrith 1962, Collette and Graves 2019).","Yellowfin Tuna are widely distributed, fast growing and highly productive (Collette and Graves 2019). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported worldwide landings showed a gradual, but variable, increase from 110,879 tonnes in 1950, to 1,130,605 tonnes in 2006 (FAO 2009). Global catches from 2006 have broadly continued to increase and have exceeded 1,400,000 tonnes in the last few years (ISSF 2020b).Two methods were used to estimate decline. In the first method ('method 1'), the linear percent change in population size over the last three generation lengths (10–14 years) was calculated using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method ('method 2') that better accounts for non-linear trends, the average annual percent change in population size over the time period for which data are available is calculated, and used to estimate the change in population size over the last three generation lengths, assuming an exponential decline. Data for the Eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans were extracted via digitization. To ensure annual data, prior to estimating changes in population size, where more than one data point existed for any given year, the average of those data points was taken. If conversely no data point corresponded to a year, we estimated that data point as the average of the preceding and following years.In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, SSB, total biomass or CPUE, there has been an estimated 8–17% decline globally for this species over the past 10–14 years. To account for differences in stock sizes, individual stocks were weighted by their MSY (ISSF 2020a). However, with the exception of the Indian Ocean where this species is overfished and overfishing is occurring, all other stocks are currently not overfished, nor experiencing overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Atlantic Ocean Yearly catch levels of Yellowfin Tuna in the Atlantic Ocean increased from slightly over 50,000 mt in the late 1950s to more than 170,000 mt in the mid-1990s (Collette and Graves 2019). The 2019 preliminary catch was 132,158 t (ICCAT 2020). The fishery is concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic, especially in the region around the Gulf of Guinea. Purse seine catches have increased over time and now account for almost 75% of the catch. Increasing fractions of purse seine sets are associated with FADs as opposed to sets on free-swimming schools. The average size of Yellowfin Tuna is smaller in FAD associated sets than free-swimming school sets. Landings of the pelagic longline fishery, which catch the largest average size Yellowfin Tuna, have decreased by more than 50% over the past 20 years. Due to changes in fishery selectivity, the average size of the fish harvested has decreased and this has resulted in a lower yield per recruit. Consequently, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the Atlantic Ocean has decreased from over 170,000 mt in the late 1970s to less than 125,000 mt today (Collette and Graves 2019).Based on the 2019 stock assessment, biomass is above the level that can support MSY on a continuing basis (e.g. not overfished; 1.17 B/B<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018) and current fishing mortality is at or near the overfishing threshold (0.96 F/F<sub>MSY</sub> in 2018). However, overall catches have exceeded the levels expected to maintain healthy stock biomass through 2033 every year since 2015 and significant overages continue to occur (ICCAT 2019). However, the Atlantic stock is not considered to be currently overfished and overfishing is not taking place (ICCAT 2020, ISSF 2020b).Although 4 Stock Synthesis (SS) and 5 production model runs were used to develop management advice for the Atlantic Ocean (ICCAT 2019), it was not possible to extract the timeseries of biomass predicted by each individual run via digitization. However, the 4 Stock Synthesis runs all displayed very similar, non-linear trends, and the 'JABBA' production model runs all displayed very similar, broadly linear trends. The production model run 'MBP' was also relatively linear but did not follow the other model runs as closely. We were able to extract the MBP run as well as one 'JABBA' run and one 'SS' run. We then calculated the average change for both methods 1 and 2, and over a 3 generation length timeperiod of 10 to 14 years. Based on method 1, the Atlantic stock of Yellowfin declined by 7% between 2007 and 2017 (or 2008–2018 as the years differ slightly between runs due to the digitization and subsequent averaging), and by 8% between 2003 and 2017 (or 2004–2018). Based on method 2, the decline was 13% from 2007–2017 (2008–2018) and 17% from 2003–2017 (2004–2018). Based on MSY, the Atlantic stock is estimated to be approximately 8% of this species' global population. Eastern Pacific Ocean Prior to 1960, baitboats were responsible for the majority of catches of Yellowfin Tuna in the Eastern Pacific, but since that time purse seine catches have dominated the fishery, accounting for 95% of the catch in 2018, while longline and other gear account for the rest. Purse seiners have targeted Yellowfin Tuna associated with dolphins, free schools, floating objects, and increasingly, those associated with drifting FADs. However, discards in the longline fleet may be of concern, where observer coverage is low. Additionally, there has been an observed change in the length composition data towards larger fish, while the longline index indicates reduction in recent years (E. Yanez pers comm. February 2021). The total catch in the Eastern Pacific has gradually increased from under 100,000 mt per year in the 1960s, to an average of 170,000 mt in the mid-70's to mid-80's, followed by a period of high productivity from the mid-80's to 2005, where the catches average about 300,000 mt, and peaking at 443,000 mt in 2002. Since 2006, a period of low productivity followed, when the catches average about 228,000 mt. Over the past five years (2014–2018), the catches averaged about 247,000 mt. Variations in catches reflect changes in fishing effort and selectivity, as well as regime shifts in productivity and year-to-year variability in recruitment. Since the mid-1970s, there appear to have been three different productivity regimes that have affected recruitment (Collette and Graves 2019). In 2019, Yellowfin catches were about 241,000 mt in the Eastern Pacific (ISSF 2020b). The most recent stock assessment used a risk analysis approach and combined the results of 48 models. There is a low probability that the spawning biomass (S) is below the dynamic maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level at the beginning of 2020 (P(S<sub>recent</sub>/S<sub>MSY_d</sub>) &lt;1) = 0.12%), and there is also a low probability that the recent fishing mortality (F) is estimated to be above the MSY level (P((F/F<sub>MSY</sub>)&gt;1) = 9% (IATTC 2020). Similarly, according to ISSF (2020b), the Yellowfin in the Eastern Pacific is currently not overfished and overfishing is not taking place.Based on mean estimates of SSB (IATTC 2020b, dataset provided by C. Minte-Vera March 2020), the estimated decline in population size using method 1 is 34% between 2009 and 2019 (i.e. 10 years) with a 28% decline between 2005 and 2019 (i.e. 14 years). Using method 2, this species shows a decline of 9% between 2009 and 2019 and 12% between 2005 and 2019, or past three generation lengths. Based on MSY, the Eastern Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 18% of this species global population. Indian Ocean Catches of Yellowfin Tuna in the Indian Ocean were less than 100,000 mt per year through the mid-1980s, and then increased rapidly, peaking at 530,000 mt in 2004. Over the past five years, catches have averaged just above 400,000 mt per year. Pelagic longlines were the dominant gear type through the 1980s, but since that time purse seine catches have increased in importance. Unlike in the other oceans, gill nets and other miscellaneous gear types account for almost 40% of the catch. Purse seine and pelagic longline fishing effort and catches declined substantially during mid to late 2000s due to concerns over Somali-based piracy in the western Indian Ocean. Not only was there a decrease in the nominal effort (number of boats, total carrying capacity, number of fishing and searching days, total number of sets), but there were also changes in the fishing behaviour due to the new security measures in place (boats working in pairs with military personnel on board, restriction on fishing areas, etc.) (Collette and Graves 2019). The catch in 2018 was 437,422 t (IOTC 2020). Yellowfin tuna catches in the Indian Ocean have been very recently partly revised (IOTC 2021).The 2018 stock assessment estimates that SB<sub>2017</sub>/SB<sub>MSY</sub> is 0.83 and F<sub>2017</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub> is 1.20. Moreover, taking into account the uncertainty surrounding these estimates, and evidence available in 2019, the yellowfin stock remains overfished and subject to overfishing (IOTC 2019). Based on ISSF (2020b), the Indian Ocean stock is overfished and overfishing is taking place due to an increase in catch levels in recent years.To estimate the proportional population change in the Indian Ocean stock over the last 10 years, we reviewed regional annual CPUE series data, with vessel effects, for the years 2007–2017 (Hoyle et al. 2018). However, there was no clear trend. We therefore assumed that the stock size has remained more or less constant over the last 10–14 years, with the caveat that other data may support a decreasing trend over the same time period. Based on MSY (IOTC 2019), the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 28% of this species global population. Western and Central Pacific Ocean Catches of Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) were less than 100,000 mt per year in the 1960s, but began to increase dramatically in the late 1970s and provisional catches in 2019 were about 681,000 tonnes. Prior to the early 1980s, pelagic longlines were responsible for the majority of catch of Yellowfin Tuna in the WCPO. Since that time, purse seines have been the dominant gear type, and now account for about 61% of the catch. Longline catches in recent years (70,000–80,000 mt) are well below levels of the late 1970s to early 1980s, which peaked at about 110,000 mt, presumably related to changes in targeting practices by some of the larger fleets (Langley et al. 2009, Collette and Graves 2019, ISSF 2020b). The 2020 stock assessment (WCPFC 2020) indicated that F/F<sub>MSY</sub> is 0.36 and SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> is 2.43. Based on method 1, B/B<sub>MSY</sub> has declined by 15% between 2005 and 2015 (i.e. 10 years) and 24% between 2001 and 2015 (i.e. 14 years). Based on method 2, the decline is 19% between 2005 and 2015, and 25% between 2001 and 2015. However, the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (WCPFC 2020, ISSF 2020b). Based on MSY, the Western and Central Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 46% of this species global population.",decreasing,"Yellowfin Tuna are a large pelagic species, occurring at sea-surface temperatures ranging from 18 to 31 °C. They spend most of their time in the mixed layer above the thermocline, but make frequent dives into cooler waters. Vertical movements of yellowfin are not restricted by the depth of the thermocline but by body temperature cooling rates and physiological tolerance at suboptimal ambient temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations encountered below the mixed layer (Schaefer et al. 2009). Repetitive bounce diving behaviour during the daytime to depths of 150–250 m, and about 12 °C ambient temperature, is common. Extensive archival tag data from Yellowfin in the eastern Pacific indicate that diving behaviour occurs about 20–40% of days, dependent on area, season, and fish size (Schaefer et al. 2011, Schaefer et al. 2014). A higher tolerance for low temperatures and oxygen concentrations was observed for larger yellowfin, which enables them to spend more time searching for prey at depths below the mixed layer. Deep-diving behaviour to an average depth of about 1,000 m and duration of 48.0 min is not uncommon, and a maximum depth of 1,602 m was observed.Vertical distribution appears to be influenced by the thermal strucxadture of the water column. There is a close correlation between the vulnerability of the fish to purse seine capture, the depth of the mixed layer, and the strength of the temperature gradient within the thermocline. Yellowfin Tuna tend to avoid waters with oxygen concentrations less than 2 m1/l. They are essentially confined to the upper 100 m of the water column in areas with marked oxyclines (upwelling zones), and are not usually caught below 250 m in the tropics. They school in surface waters primarily by size, either in monospecific or multi-species groups, and are often associated with floating objects. In some areas, such as the Eastern Pacific, larger fish (greater than 85 cm FL) frequently are associated with porpoises.Yellowfin Tuna are opportunistic visual predators that consume a wide diversity of prey types. By volume, fishes, squids, and crustaceans are the most important diet items (Alverson 1963, Dragovich 1970, Dragovich and Potthoff 1972, Manooch and Mason 1983, Matthews et al. 1977, Collette and Graves 2019). The primary Atlantic spawning grounds are in the Gulf of Guinea, and to a lesser extent in the Gulf of Mexico. Spawning in the Eastern Pacific was observed to be widespread from 26°N to 14°S and from the coast to 140°W, the western extent of sampling ovaries for histological evaluations. Between 0°N and 20°N, spawning occurred continuously throughout the year, with no pronounced seasonal patterns in intensity. North of 20°N, spawning took place primarily during July through November, when sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) exceeded about 24°C. South of 0° spawning occurred during November through February, again when SSTs exceeded about 24 °C. The proportions of reproductively-active females found within an area were correlated with monthly SSTs. 85.3% of the spawning occurred between 26 °C and 30 °C. Spawning occurs almost entirely at night between 2200 h and 0600 h (Schaefer 1998).Some adult Yellowfin Tuna remain in the nursery area of the main Hawaiian Islands, but other disperse offshore into the central Pacific (Lam et al. 2020). Maximum Size documented in the Eastern Pacific is 206 cm FL, 202 kg (445 lb) (K. Schaefer, pers. comm., February 2021). The IGFA all-tackle game fish record is of a 427 lb (193.68 kg) fish caught off Cabo San Lucas, Baja California, Mexico (IGFA, 2020).In the Indian Ocean, longevity is at least seven years (Romanov and Korotkova 1988), although very few individuals live past four years. Estimated maximum age in the Eastern Pacific is 8 years (K. Schaefer, pers. comm., February 2021), in the Western Pacific, 6.5 years (Lehodey and Leroy 1999), and in the Atlantic, 18 years (Andrews 2020). However, there is some doubt to the maximum age in the Atlantic, which was based on a radio bomb carbon (K. Schaefer, pers. comm. February 2021). The smallest mature individuals in the Pacific off the Philippines and Central America are in the 50–60 cm size group at an age of 12–15 months. Length at 50% maturity in the Eastern Pacific was 69 cm for males and 92 cm for females, corresponding to an age of 2.1 years (Schaefer 1998). In the Western Indian Ocean, length at 50% maturity was 75 cm FL (Zudaire et al. 2013) and in the Sea of Oman 77.2 cm (Hosseini and Kaymaram 2016). Batch fecundity estimates in the Eastern Pacific ranged from 162,918 oocytes for a 1,180 mm female to 8,026,026 oocytes for a 1,460 mm female (Schaefer 1988). In the Western Indian Ocean, average batch fecundity for females 79-147 cm FL was estimated to be 3.1 million eggs (Zudaire et al. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, generation length was estimated to be between 2.2 and 3.5 years based on age-structure data across all stocks (Collette et al. 2011), and decline was calculated over a period of 10 years. However, given new estimates of longevity of potentially up to 18 years and an age of first maturity of 2.4 years, application of equation GL = Tm + 0.15*(T<sub>max</sub> - T<sub>m</sub>) (Collette et al. 2011) yields a generation length of 4.7 years. To account for uncertainty in this new longevity and generation length estimate, declines were calculated over a three generation length time period of 10–14 years.","Increased catches from purse seine fleets fishing on FADS have resulted in higher fishing mortality rates on small undesirable sizes, significant changes in overall size selectivity, and thus reduced maximum sustainable yields. Increases in purse seine capacity and efficiency, in combination with a lack of meaningful conservation measures to limit juvenile harvests is of concern in many areas (Collette and Graves 2019).In the Atlantic Ocean, Yellowfin Tuna are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, catches have recently been above the levels needed to maintain healthy biomass in the long term, as well as up to 35% above quotas in recent years (ICCAT 2019), and recent stock status is based on potential overestimates of longevity and subsequent adjustments to mortality rates. Yellowfin Tuna in the Eastern Pacific Ocean are not currently overfished or subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). However, the 2019 stock status of Yellowfin Tuna in the Indian Ocean is overfished and subject to overfishing (IOTC 2019). Compliance with mandatory catch reductions has been poor, and catches from nations exempt from reductions have been increasing.Based on the 2017 stock assessment, Yellowfin Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean are not overfished or subject to overfishing. The fishery impact is highest in the tropical region, caused primarily by purse seine fisheries in the equatorial Pacific and miscellaneous gears within the Western Pacific. Based on the diagnostic case, there has been a steady increase in both juvenile and adult fishing mortality since the 1970s. The increase in adult fishing mortality has been continuous over most of the time series, while juvenile fishing mortality has stabilized since the late 1990s at around the current adult fishing mortality level (WCPFC 2019).","This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).The IATTC has adopted an interim harvest control rule for tropical tunas. Current conservation measures for Yellowfin Tuna include a 72-day closure for large purse seine vessels (&gt;182 mt capacity), a limit on the overall capacity of the vessels, a time area closure west of the Galápagos Islands, and limits on the number of FADs a vessel can deploy (Collette and Graves 2019).In the Atlantic Ocean, recent catch averages are expected to further degrade the condition of the stock if continued. It therefore appears that existing conservation and management measures are insufficient and need to be strengthened or more strictly enforced. Increased harvests of small Yellowfin Tuna caught in association with FADs could also negatively impact long-term sustainable yield and stock status. To increase the long-term sustainable yield, the recommendation is that effective measures be found to decrease fishing mortality of small Yellowfin (e.g. FAD-related and other fishing mortality of small Yellowfin Tuna) (ICCAT 2019). Current management measures include a total allowable catch for the Atlantic (but not individual country quotas), a two month Atlantic-wide closure on FAD fishing in 2020 (three months in 2021), limitations on the number of FADs deployed per vessel, and capacity limits on the number of purse seine and longline vessels for some countries (Collette and Graves 2019).In the Indian Ocean, the stock status has declined to below MSY reference level and the cause is not well understood due to various uncertainties. The Commission is advised, as a precautionary measure, to ensure a reduction in catches to end overfishing and allow SSB to recover to SSB<sub>MSY</sub> levels. Revised specific catch limits are recommended (IOTC 2021). A rebuilding plan is being developed for the stock, with current conservation measures including catch limits by gear type, a FAD management plan, a ban on discards of tropical tunas, and a mandate to develop and implement a quota allocation system (Collette and Graves 2019). In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, the advice following the 2017 stock assessment was that WCPFC could consider measures that decrease fishing mortality from fisheries that take juveniles, with the aim of increasing maximum fishery yields and reducing any further impacts on the stock's spawning potential in the tropical regions. It is also recommended that measures be implemented to maintain current spawning biomass levels until an appropriate target reference point has been agreed upon by the Commission (WCPFC 2019). Active conservation measures include a limit on Yellowfin Tuna catches and vessel freezing capacity (not to increase), no discards of tropical tunas, and a three-month closure on FAD fishing in tropical waters, limits on the total number of vessel days, and a FAD management plan (Collette and Graves 2019).","Yellowfin Tuna are caught in commercial fisheries around the world, with an end value of USD 15.8 billion in 2018 (Pew, 2020).They are caught by a variety of gears, including purse seine, pelagic longline, gill net, and pole and line. The species also supports recreational fisheries in many locations. Purse seine catches account for the largest catches of Yellowfin Tuna in all oceans, with the vast majority destined for canneries, while larger fish from longline fisheries are sold fresh or frozen, with some individuals entering the sashimi markets (Collette and Graves 2019). Additionally, FADs are being used to take juvenile fish."

It occurs from the surface down to depths of at least 330 m. The species exhibits moderately slow life history characteristics. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth. and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 250 reefs in 39 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 48.8% over three generation lengths (37 years). Therefore, the Whitetip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (37 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Whitetip Reef Shark is widespread in the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean from western Africa to the Eastern Pacific (Last and Stevens 2009, Whitney et al. 2012).","Genetic studies support multiple subpopulations of Whitetip Reef Sharks, with the clearest separation between the Pacific and Indian Oceans (Whitney et al. 2012). There is also evidence that there is population structure in the Pacific Ocean, possibly drive by isolation by distance (Whitney et al. 2012). For example, samples from the northern and southern Great Barrier Reef showed differentiation. Samples from the Eastern Pacific (Costa Rica) have low genetic diversity (a single mitochondrial haplotype) but are genetically similar to those from the Central Pacific.There are numerous reports of declines in reef shark populations throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans (e.g. MacNeil et al. 2020; Graham et al. 2010), but few specific to Whitetip Reef Sharks. Robbins et al. (2006) reported ongoing collapse on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), with an estimated decline of 80% on reefs with the fewest fishing restrictions based on diver surveys. Later research using baited remote underwater video (Espinoza et al. 2014) and fishing surveys (Heupel et al. 2009) suggest the declines were less dramatic than reported by Robbins et al. (2006), and that increases in unfished areas of the GBR had resulted in some recovery. Nadonet al. (2012), using towed diver surveys, showed that reef shark populations, including Whitetip Reef Sharks, were at carrying capacity on reefs uninhabited by humans, but had declined to very low levels (&lt;3% of carrying capacity) on inhabited islands (e.g. main Hawaiian Islands, Guam). In the areas with large declines, the relative importance of Whitetip Reef Sharks on reefs had increased relative to other reef shark species.Given the population structure observed in Whitetip Reef Sharks it is difficult to assess the global status of this species from patchy accounts of possible declines in some parts of its range.To account for differences in the trajectory of Whitetip Reef Shark subpopulations among locations spatial variation in an index of population abundance was constructed from the Global Finprint project that sampled in nations containing 88.6% of the coral reefs within the species’ historic range (MacNeil et al. 2020). This is the largest data set available to assess the status of this species. The analysis estimate depletion by reef by comparing local abundance indices to a level inferred to represent no depletion (median of positive values) (see Supplementary Information). Reef level depletion estimates were aggregated by jurisdiction and weighted by jurisdictional coral reef area (relative to global coral reef area) to produce an estimate of global depletion. The coral reef area weighted population depletion of Whitetip Reef Sharks was estimated as 48.8% (standard error 39.8–57.7%) and assumed to have occurred over the past three generation lengths (~37 years) (see Supplementary Information). As such it is concluded that the Whitetip Reef Shark population has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% in the last 3 generation lengths (~37 years) and is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.",decreasing,"The Whitetip Reef Shark is demersal on the continental shelves and around oceanic islands and reefs at depths of 0–330 m (Randall 1977). It is closely associated with coral reefs in clear tropical waters (Compagno 1984). It reaches a maximum size of 200 cm total length (TL) but adults are very rare over 160 cm. Size-at-maturity is about 105 cm TL (Randall 1977). Reproduction is viviparous with yolk-sac placenta, small litters of 1–5 (Last and Stevens 2009), an annual reproductive cycle, and a size-at-birth of 52–60 cm TL. Growth is slow in the wild, estimated at 2.1–4.2 cm year<sup>-1</sup> (Randall 1977), and they may attain sexual maturity at eight to nine years and live to about 16 years (Randall 1977, Smith et al. 1998). Generation length is estimated to be 12.3 years (Randall 1977).","The Whitetip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scalelongline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza et al. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon et al. 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common. The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil et al. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.","There are few species-specific conservation measures in place. Queensland, Australia has a trip limit of one in place for commercial and recreational fishers. Some countries across its range have banned the targeted fishing for sharks (e.g. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Palau, French Polynesia, Cook Islands). However, incidental catches frequently occur in artisanal fisheries that are often exempt from these rules. However, there are many general management measures that contribute to conserving this species. Marine Protected Areas that incorporate &gt;20 km of coral reef can provide significant protections because of the limited movements observed in this species (Dwyer et al. 2020).

This species is used in commercial fisheries for human consumption, fish meal and oil. It is also a gamefish and has value in the aquarium trade. This species is important commercially, recreationally and in the aquarium trade; however, there are no species specific conservation efforts in place.In at least one part of its range, off Mauritania, this species experienced a rate of decrease in biomass of 7% over a period of 24 years. It continues to be heavily exploited off Mauritania. Due to the lack of comprehensive stock assessments, and little information on the level at which this species is caught as bycatch in wide-ranging continental shelf to upper slope trawl fisheries, this species is assessed as Data Deficient.Although this species is relatively common and has large geographic range, fishing regulations should be implemented for this species in the regions where this species is commercially important.","Itoccurs in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and in Indo-West Pacific region from South Africa to Kenya.

Trends in demersal fisheries off the continental shelf of Mauritania The fisheries of the northwestern African continental shelf have developed over the past several decades from low levels of fishing to intense exploitation, leading to severe decreases in biomass and serious signs of over-exploitation. In general, the abundance of demersal resources of northwest Africa has declined by a factor of four over the past 20 to 30 years. Over the Mauritanian continental shelf, reductions in biomass of up to 75% have been recorded. Using data from scientific surveys conducted in Mauritanian waters, trends in species biomass weremodelledfor 24 taxa, 15 of which showed significant decreasing trends, and only one of which showed increases in abundance. ForZ. faber, mean yearly rates of decrease in biomass of ~4.9% off of the Mauritanian continental shelf were calculated over using a model fitted to trends seen from 1989 to 2006; using models fitted to trends seen in 1982-2006, decreases in yearly biomass approximated 7%. Decreases in biomass from the early years in the time series were nearly 10 fold. Offshore species were more heavily impacted than coastal species, These trends may be reflective of the fishing pressure experienced also by this species in Senegal and Guinea (Gascuelet al.2007). In a scientific survey conducted off of Senegal, this species was encountered in relatively low numbers compared to other species with a catch per hour of 0.8 kg/hr and comprised 0.1% of the total catch (CRDOT survey).

In the English Channel, the mean length of first maturity was estimated at 26 cm in males and 34.5 cm in females. Zeus faber occurs near the bottom and feeds on a variety of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans. This species is usually solitary and spawns in the spring in the northeast Atlantic. The eggs of this species are pelagic.Itreaches maturity at age four and usually occurs over continental and island shelves of eastern Atlantic.

Zeus faber is usually caught with bottom trawls and is an excellent food fish; it is marketed fresh, frozen, dried-salted and smoked. This species is also processed for fish meal and oil ( Heemstra in press) The 1978 catch reported for this species from the fishing area 34 and fishing area 47 (Eastern Central Atlantic, ECA) is 493 t (Morocco, 105; U.S.S.R., 287 t; Portugal, 78 t; Japan, 23 t) (Fisheries and Aquaculture Department 2012).
